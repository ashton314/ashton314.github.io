My name's Ashton Wiersdorf. I hail from Utah; I'm currently studying computer science [Brigham Young University](https://byu.edu). I've sung with the [BYU Men's Chorus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choirs_at_Brigham_Young_University) and I play the piano. Other hobbies include swimming and hiking—Utah has some of the most diverse landscape anywhere in the US: from dense forests to baren desert. If you visit I highly recommend checking out some of the national parks.

I have been married to my wife Sarah since 2018; we met when we were in high school and she's been my best friend ever since. You can see her blog [here](https://scwiersdorf.github.io/).

I'm a command line addict; most of my work is done with Emacs. My current technology preferences are:

 - Emacs
 - [Selectrum](https://github.com/raxod502/selectrum) for somethings, [Ivy](https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper) for others
 - Zsh

Over the past year or two I've made some extensive modifications to my configuration. You can get my .emacs config files on [my GitHub repo](https://github.com/ashton314/.dotfiles).

This blog started out as a class assignment. Since then it's evolved into a place for me to write about some ideas and technology I'm excited about. I change my mind a lot; I'm still learning, so things written here should not be understood as an immutable reflection of my opinions.

If you'd like to talk to me about anything I've written here, try [Keybase](https://keybase.io/ashton314) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/a_wiersdorf). If something is *really* urgent, you can find my email on my résumé, which should be linked on this page as well.
