When I was a little kid I wanted to be a computer programmer like my daddy. I wanted to have my own cubicle and a work station and write Perl programs all day long in Emacs.\nThere was a phase where I had to shake my head at that—a cubicle-dweller? Seriously? After experiencing some open-office work spaces, the shoulder-high walls afforded a privacy and sound muffling that any hipster coder would be envious of.\nWhen I turned 16 I got my first job as an intern at my dad\u0026#39;s company. My dad was an architect at this point I think, and writing web apps with APIs and clean separation of concerns was the gold standard. My efforts were focused on web development and learning the tech stacks one normally learns with the web.1\nBy the time I got to college I wanted to be an architect. I knew I would have to rise through the ranks though, so I put a lot of effort into learning how to program web applications. I studied my data structures and algorithms so I could hit that sweet \\(O(\\log(n))\\) bracket of the Programmer Competency Matrix.\nThat started to change as I worked in industry. I landed some really nice jobs with TazWorks and Spiff. Spiff was basically the perfect job for me—or so I thought.\nHalf way through college I started leaning harder into my love of programming languages and mathematics. I didn\u0026#39;t know programming languages was a field in its own right until a professor asked me if I would be interested in doing PL research. That opened a door to me to paths that I didn\u0026#39;t know existed, but always wanted. I admired the likes of Larry Wall and José Valim who built languages rather than just used them. I could see a path towards working on languages now.\nNow I\u0026#39;m in the middle of a PhD at the University of Utah. The life of an academic is really appealing: I\u0026#39;d get to do research, maybe some consulting on the side, and I would be able to teach others about the beauty I find in computer science. The plan right now is to one day teach, but I\u0026#39;m glad there are other options available to me I\u0026#39;m incredibly grateful for the time I was able to spend in industry honing my craft. It\u0026#39;s nice to have a fallback if academia doesn\u0026#39;t work out. I sampled the good and bad of industry jobs, so that way, should I choose to remain in academia, it will be an informed decision. I\u0026#39;m glad I was able to sample so much and choose; I\u0026#39;m also grateful I was able to undo some of the self-inflicted pigeonholing of my younger years—instead of chasing what I thought was the end-goal of my interests, I followed my real interests and they led me to something different entirely.\nFootnotes 1 For sufficiently niche values of \u0026#34;normal\u0026#34;—I didn\u0026#39;t get too deep into JavaScript, hated PHP, and never touched any of the big enterprisey languages like Java or the shudder .NET framework.\n"},{"id":1,"href":"/posts/2023-01-17_what_is_a_type_system_really/","title":"What is a type system, really?","section":"Technical Blog","content":" Background This is a question I\u0026#39;ve been wrestling with for a little bit. My first experience with a type system was with Java, and I didn\u0026#39;t like it. It just felt like an annoying constraint on the kinds of programs I could write. I was coming from Perl, which sports weak dynamic typing, so Java\u0026#39;s rigidity came as a bit of a shock.\nAfter Java I learned some C, which too has types. C\u0026#39;s types are different from Java\u0026#39;s in a big way: in C they\u0026#39;re really just directives to the compiler on how to interpret some bytes. \u0026#34;Everything is just void *\u0026#34; is kind of true. In C, bytes can be interpreted however you wish.\nAs I matured as a developer, I realized that sometimes I wanted constraints on what I could program. I wanted to have some way to narrow the scope of possibilities of things my program could do. While that may sound bad at first glance, consider if you could narrow the scope of ways your program would go wrong. That\u0026#39;s what types are designed to do.\nNot all type systems are equally powerful: while Java\u0026#39;s type system prevents certain classes of errors, a NullPointerException crops up here and there to blow your (well-typed!) program out of the water. Languages like Rust or Kotlin sport type systems that prevent NullPointerExceptions or segfaults from ever cropping up. The trade-off is that these type systems often take a little more time to get used to, and might make it harder to write certain kinds of programs.\nNew advances in type systems are mitigating those trade-offs, however. Kotlin\u0026#39;s type system does away with NullPointerExceptions without being too much more complex than Java\u0026#39;s, and things like gradual typing1 make the cost curve of adding static types to a dynamically typed codebase much smoother. The more I learn, the more I see that I can do with types.\nWhat is a type system? In one sense types are just sets of values that an expression can take on. Suppose I have a variable of type Int: this implies the values it will be bound to belong to the set ℤ. This view of types is really good for thinking about how algebraic types work: when I take the product of two types (e.g. Int × Bool), I\u0026#39;m describing values that belong to the set of ordered pairs {(n,b) | n ∈ ℤ, b ∈ 𝔹} or the cross-product of the sets ℤ × 𝔹. Tuples and structs are usually how product types are realized in a programming language.\nThe same goes for sum types and set unions. A sum type is the union of two or more types; if I have a variable of type Nat + Bool, then it can be a number or a boolean. Tagged unions and enums are typically how you see sum types in programming languages.\nIf you consider the cardinality of a type, the metaphor continues to work.2 For example, if I have a type called a Byte that holds an integer between 0 and 255, and I pair it with a boolean in a tuple to produce the type Byte × Bool, then there will be 256 × 2 = 512 different values that inhabit the type Byte × Bool. Likewise with a sum type, where a value can be either Byte or Bool, then there are 256 + 2 = 258 different inhabitants of the type.\nEvery type system that I know of has some set of primitive types along with ways of combining those types into bigger structures. Primitive types typically include numbers, booleans, and strings, while combining structures usually include records (or structs, i.e. product types) and enumerations (i.e. sum types).\nStatic typing, dynamic typing, and type inference Languages with a static type system are ones where the type of an expression—be it a variable, literal, compound expression, function call, etc.—is discernible without running the program. Haskell, Rust, Java, C, C++, Go, etc. are all statically typed languages.\nIn contrast, in a dynamic type system, the types of expressions are not knowable until runtime. The language implementation has to insert checks before e.g. performing an addition to make sure the types line up right. Perl, Python, Ruby, JavaScript, Scheme, Clojure, etc. are dynamically typed languages.\nSome static languages like Java require you to write down the type of every variable, expression, and function. Others, like Rust and Haskell, do something called type inference: this is where the type checker is able to infer, based off of the types of literal data as well as the operators in use, what the types for a program should be. This is different than a dynamic type system: just because you didn\u0026#39;t write down what type a variable was, doesn\u0026#39;t mean it is now dynamically typed. In Rust, Haskell, etc., every expression still has a type—it\u0026#39;s just inferred rather than explicitly given by you, the programmer.\nNominal vs. Structural Some types are nominal and others are structural. These notions describe how two types are considered equal. Nominal types are what you get all over in Java: for two objects to be of the same type, they must both be of the same class. It doesn\u0026#39;t matter if you have two classes like:\npublic class Foo { int thing_1; boolean thing_2; } public class Bar { int thing_1; boolean thing_2; } Even though the members of Foo and Bar have the same interface and even the same names, a value of type Foo will never be the same as type Bar.\nStructural types determine equivalence based off of their algebraic structure. Most types in Haskell, ML, Typed Racket, and others work this way. This is kind of like a generalization of interfaces: if two types \u0026#34;implement\u0026#34; the \u0026#34;same interface\u0026#34; of having the same structure, they can be considered equivalent and interchangeable. However, some types in Typed Racket, like those based off of structures, are nominal—you don\u0026#39;t have to be all structural or all nominal in your language.\nMost of the time I find it easier to think in terms of structural types. There are times when nominal types make more sense, though. It\u0026#39;s nice when your language gives you the flexibility to choose.\nWhy do we care about type systems? I think most computer scientists are familiar with the Halting Problem, but Rice\u0026#39;s Theorem is slightly less well-known.3 Rice\u0026#39;s theorem states:\nAll non-trivial semantic properties of programs are undecidable.\nWikipedia\nWhat is a semantic property? In contrast with a syntactic property, which is aspect apparent in the text of the program, a semantic property deals with what happens when the program runs. For example, \u0026#34;does this program halt?\u0026#34; is a semantic property, and the same semantic property covered by Turing\u0026#39;s Halting Problem. \u0026#34;Does this program contain any if statements?\u0026#34; is a syntactic property. \u0026#34;Does control reach this point in the program?\u0026#34; or \u0026#34;What values flow here?\u0026#34; are both semantic questions.\nType systems can turn certain semantic properties into syntactic ones: we can turn questions about the program\u0026#39;s runtime behavior (e.g. \u0026#34;Does a function taking integers get applied to a boolean causing a type error?\u0026#34;) into questions we can answer by examining the syntax of our program—if we have a statically typed language, we can tell—without running the program itself—whether or not no type errors ever occur.\nThere will still be programs when it\u0026#39;s impossible to decide whether or not the program has a type error:\n(+ (if (goldbach-conjecture-true?) \u0026#34;not a number\u0026#34; 42)) but in these cases we can restrict ourselves to programs that definitely do not have any type errors.\nBeyond sets: types as a meta language Something I\u0026#39;ve learned recently is that \u0026#34;type system\u0026#34; is just what we call meta-languages for our programming languages. The language of types describes the behavior of a program written in another language.\nConsider the following program in Typed Racket:\n(: add1 (-\u0026gt; Number Number)) (define (add1 n) (+ 1 n)) The annotation (: add1 (-\u0026gt; Number Number)) is a proposition that add1 is a function that takes some value belonging to the set ℕ and gives back another thing in the set ℕ.\nNow if we call that function:\n(let ([seven : Number 7]) (add1 seven)) the : Number bit on the first line is a proposition that the variable seven will take on a value in the set ℕ.4 Now, in the meta-language of types, we can check that the type of the argument seven matches with the type of the parameter n in add1. In this case, the types match, so we proceed. If the declared or inferred type of the argument did not line up, our type checker would complain that we had violated the rules of the meta-language. These rules in the meta-language, of course, correspond to the actual runtime properties of Racket. More on that later in § Erasure.\nTypes other than values Many object-oriented (OO) languages have a notion of public and private variables. Visibility is another thing type systems enforce. Annotating a variable as being private is a proposition that it is only accessed in certain parts of the program, which is something the type checker can then ensure is enforced.\nTainting is another thing you might want from a type system: tainting refers to marking user-supplied data as \u0026#34;tainted\u0026#34;, and any attempt to e.g. modify this data or branch off of the value is prohibited, unless the data has been \u0026#34;sanitized\u0026#34; by e.g. explicitly parsing well-formed data with regular expressions or the like. This is supposed to help protect against injection attacks.\nA type system could have a wrapper type Tainted\u0026lt;A\u0026gt; that takes some data of any type and protects it from dangerous operations. Then you\u0026#39;d have functions like regex_sanitize :: Tainted\u0026lt;String\u0026gt;, Regex → String for when you want to parse a tainted string to get some data out of it.\nErasure There is usually some kind of check to make sure that the propositions in the meta-language correspond to the program we\u0026#39;re describing. Without this check, there wouldn\u0026#39;t be anything stopping me from writing:\n(let ([seven : Number \u0026#34;definitely not a number!\u0026#34;]) (add1 seven)) and the program would still type check if it just blindly trusted the type annotations. Of course, as soon as the program runs, the runtime would explode at the add1 exception. Removing the types after checking is called \u0026#34;type erasure\u0026#34;, as the types are erased after type checking and the program gets run as if they had never been there.\nSome languages like Haskell and Java do this. This is safe to do because we\u0026#39;re only running programs that we\u0026#39;ve proven are well-typed. The upside to this is that we can save a lot of overhead by removing type checks. The downside is that certain kinds of runtime introspection might not be possible. Java, for example, doesn\u0026#39;t keep type parameters around on generics. Wikipedia has a good example of where ArrayList\u0026lt;Integer\u0026gt; and ArrayList\u0026lt;Float\u0026gt; both report the same thing under .getClass() at runtime.\nOne place to be careful is when typed and untyped code mix. This is where gradual typing comes in. Most languages are either statically typed or dynamically typed, but a growing number of languages are either being adapted to support or are being developed out of the box with support for gradual types. In these languages, like Typed Racket, you have to insert runtime checks to make sure code coming from an untyped module into a typed module agrees with the type guarantees.\nThere\u0026#39;s a lot of hidden complexity around gradual typing. Ben Greenman has many papers outlining some of the intricacies around the semantics of gradual typing.\nWat can go wrong TypeScript is a bit of an odd language. The main page proclaims \u0026#34;TypeScript becomes JavaScript via the delete key\u0026#34; and just erases all types after type checking. You can call TypeScript modules from JavaScript, and TypeScript doesn\u0026#39;t put in any runtime checks. For example, you can do:\nfunction add2(a : number, b number) : number { return a + b; } console.log(add2(2, 7)); console.log(add2(\u0026#34;foo\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;bar\u0026#34;)); and get the result:\n9 foobar TypeScript\u0026#39;s type guarantees are only locally sound. As soon as your typed and untyped parts mix, your program will fall back on the very wat-worthy typing rules of JavaScript.\nWhen layers mix How much can you program in this meta language of types? I\u0026#39;m still trying to understand this. Dependent types allow types to depend on values; i.e. you can have a type for \u0026#34;list with three integers\u0026#34;. Dependent typing, as I understand it, opens up complete programmability of the type system, at the cost of type checking becoming undecidable. These type systems allow you describe the behavior of your programs with incredible precision.\nI\u0026#39;ve done a little work with Coq, which supports dependent types. I haven\u0026#39;t done enough yet to really understand it well though!\nTypes as a design tool Beyond the neat safety properties that type systems give me, I really like using types as a design tool. So often I\u0026#39;ll be working on transforming some data or pulling together information from multiple different sources to decide something, and it\u0026#39;s easy to get lost in the lines of code. What helps is for me to think of a function in terms of the shape of its inputs and the shape of the needed output. (This is part of the reason why I like structural type systems so much.) With the types in hand, the program almost writes itself.\nIndeed, there are times when the program can write itself! If you write down the type of a function, it\u0026#39;s not hard for an editor to suggest programs that satisfy that type. With more expressive types, the better the suggestions will be. To see an example of this in action, check out the type checker I made with μKanren, which can accept a type and generate expressions that satisfy it.\nOne thing that I like about this kind of program generation is the programs will definitely be correct, in the sense they\u0026#39;ll be well-typed. ML systems like GitHub Copilot are very impressive, but there\u0026#39;s always some chance that they\u0026#39;ll go completely wrong. Type-driven code suggestions can always be safe!\nDespite how cool type-driven code generation is, and how valuable the safety guarantees that types provide are, I find types to be of greatest aid as a tool for thinking and reasoning about my programs.\nAgain, what are type systems? Type systems provide a way of writing down properties of our programs that we would like to be true, and then mechanically checking that those properties hold. Type systems come in all shapes and sizes; some are more expressive than others. Types are also a great tool to use when actually writing code.\nStatic type systems provide strong guarantees about program behavior at the expense of some friction in programming: dynamic languages make it easy to throw together a prototype, but can become unwieldy or difficult to maintain once the codebase grows. Gradual typing is an increasingly popular method to get the best of both worlds.\nFurther reading I\u0026#39;d recommend checking out the Lambda Cube. Other books that I\u0026#39;ve read or am reading that have helped me understand types a bit better include:\nPractical Foundations for Programming Languages, by Robert Harper Types and Programming Languages, by Benjamin Pierce Semantics Engineering with PLT Redex, by Matthias Felleisen, Robert Findler, and Matthew Flatt Programming Languages: Application and Interpretation, by Shriram Krishnamurthi5 I\u0026#39;ve also written a post about how to write a type checker that hopefully should be pretty easy to follow.\nAcknowledgments Thanks to my advisor Ben Greenman for reading a draft and correcting some inaccuracies in the erasure and gradual typing portions. Thanks also to Scott Wiersdorf and Alex Larsen for providing feedback and some much-needed polishing.\nFootnotes 1 Gradual typing was first proposed by Jeremy Siek. The Wikipedia page on Gradual Typing has a decent introduction.\n2 This should suggest the relationship between sums and products in types and algebra is a deep one!\n3 Next time someone asks you to write a program that does some static analysis of a semantic property, you can say to them (in your best Vizzini voice of course), \u0026#34;you fell for one of the classic blunders! The first is never get involved in a Turing-machine halting problem. The second which is slightly less well-known, never attempt to use static analysis when semantics are on the line!\u0026#34;\nAt this point it\u0026#39;s generally appropriate to laugh manically before falling over dead from iocane poisoning.\n4 Typed Racket would actually derive the type Positive-Byte for seven which is a subtype of Number. Typed Racket\u0026#39;s numeric type hierarchy is quite impressive!\n5 The book is available online here: https://www.plai.org/ The sections on types and type checking are quite excellent.\n"},{"id":2,"href":"/posts/2022-12-27_repl_buffer_on_the_right/","title":"Make an Emacs Buffer Open the Way You Want","section":"Technical Blog","content":" Are you tired of having a particular buffer pop open in the wrong direction? Do you wish, for example, that the Racket REPL buffer showed up on the right in a vertical split, rather than below in a horizontal one? Look no further. I give you, display-buffer-alist:\n(add-to-list \u0026#39;display-buffer-alist \u0026#39;(\u0026#34;\\\\*Racket REPL \u0026lt;/\u0026gt;\\\\*\u0026#34; (display-buffer-in-direction) (direction . right))) That little snippet will make sure when you hit C-c C-k inside of a racket-mode buffer, a REPL will pop up on the right-side instead of on the bottom. I find that much more comfortable to use.\nThe variable display-buffer-alist is a fantastically useful variable. There\u0026#39;s so much to it that I can\u0026#39;t write it up in a blog post. Fortunately, the indomitable Mickey Petersen has written up a fantastic article about how Emacs manages windows which you should definitely check out. Here are just some of the settings that I use:\nConfiguration for dedicated Eshell buffers If you don\u0026#39;t use Eshell already, it\u0026#39;s definitely worth a look. You might justly wonder, \u0026#34;why should I use something that\u0026#39;s inferior to $TERMINAL_EMULATOR_OF_CHOICE?\u0026#34; Good question. I still make heavy use of my terminal, but I really like how I can use completion frameworks like Vertico or Corfu with Orderless to search through history. If you\u0026#39;ve put a bunch of effort into configuring Emacs in those ways, it\u0026#39;s really nice to port that across.\nI also used Eshell to great effect when I was debugging my implementation of Raft for a class. I had a ton of log messages getting dumped out to the screen, and on my terminal, the lines always wrap. Maybe there\u0026#39;s a setting to enable horizontal scrolling, but I couldn\u0026#39;t find it. With Eshell, that just comes right out of the box.\nOn top of getting long lines to play nice, I can also use the powerful search and filtering operations that I\u0026#39;m used to using to navigate my code to navigate through my terminal history.\nThere\u0026#39;s a lot more, but those features have intrigued me enough that I wanted to make it easy to pop open to Eshell whenever I could. Here\u0026#39;s what I use:\n;; Don\u0026#39;t forget to bind these functions to convenient keys (defun startup-eshell () \u0026#34;Fire up an eshell buffer or open the previous one\u0026#34; (interactive) (if (get-buffer-window \u0026#34;*eshell*\u0026lt;42\u0026gt;\u0026#34;) (delete-window (get-buffer-window \u0026#34;*eshell*\u0026lt;42\u0026gt;\u0026#34;)) (eshell 42))) (defun tab-to-eshell () \u0026#34;Open a tab with eshell. If that tab doesn\u0026#39;t exist, create it. If already in that tab, switch to previous tab.\u0026#34; (interactive) (if (equal (tab-bar-tab-name-current) \u0026#34;*eshell*\u0026lt;43\u0026gt;\u0026#34;) (tab-bar-switch-to-prev-tab) (eshell 43))) (add-to-list \u0026#39;display-buffer-alist \u0026#39;(\u0026#34;\\\\*eshell\\\\*\u0026lt;43\u0026gt;\u0026#34; (display-buffer-in-tab) (tab-name . \u0026#34;*eshell*\u0026lt;43\u0026gt;\u0026#34;))) (add-to-list \u0026#39;display-buffer-alist \u0026#39;(\u0026#34;\\\\*eshell\\\\*\u0026lt;42\u0026gt;\u0026#34; (display-buffer-in-side-window) (side . left) (window-width . 0.5) (window-height . fit-window-to-buffer))) I wanted to be able to open an Eshell buffer on the left side of the window whenever, and I also wanted to be able to make a dedicated tab that I could toggle between easily. With startup-eshell and tab-to-eshell respectively, I can do just that.\nOrg-Roam I like using Org-roam for note taking. I wanted to make the backlinks buffer always appear in a narrow-ish window on the right. Here\u0026#39;s all the config needed:\n;; Dedicated side window for backlinks (add-to-list \u0026#39;display-buffer-alist \u0026#39;(\u0026#34;\\\\*org-roam\\\\*\u0026#34; (display-buffer-in-side-window) (side . right) (window-width . 0.4) (window-height . fit-window-to-buffer))) Things to note There\u0026#39;s a difference between display-buffer-in-side-window and display-buffer-in-direction: the first, if I\u0026#39;m not mistaken, makes a dedicated window, which you can read about on Mickey Petersen\u0026#39;s site. The short of it is, that buffer will stay in that space and will not move, even if you\u0026#39;re used to your windows automatically re-laying out with e.g. evil-mode enabled.\nThe second is a little gentler, at least in my mind. It asks Emacs to open the buffer in one direction rather than another, and it\u0026#39;s just as if you had done C-x 2 or C-x 3 for up/down or left/right respectively.\nYet again, this is another testament to the fantastic power and flexibility of Emacs. This isn\u0026#39;t a life-changing configuration per se, but it definitely makes Emacs more comfortable to use for me.\n"},{"id":3,"href":"/posts/personal/2022-12-25_christmas/","title":"Christmas 2022","section":"Personal Blog","content":" This year I discovered the profound joy of giving toys to a little girl.

But by and large we\u0026#39;ve been unimpeded from doing things that bring us joy.\nI started my PhD! It was difficult for me to leave Spiff: I enjoyed working there, the work was interesting, and I have never worked on a team that cared so much about programming as a craft.

There are differences between myself and members of my family and my in-laws—some pretty deep ones too—but everyone put those differences aside for Christmas and we celebrated in a way that just felt happy and good.\nThere\u0026#39;s a lot I have to be thankful for. Peace in various parts of my life is something I\u0026#39;m cherishing more than normal this year. May we all be generous peacemakers. I\u0026#39;m still working on it, but it\u0026#39;s worthwhile to keep trying. Be the slack and the flex in the system: absorb jostles and bumps, unjust as they are. We need worry more about what we can give in our relationships and less about what we might think we are owed. There\u0026#39;s a balance there: we shouldn\u0026#39;t allow ourselves to be abused—but trying to be a little kinder never hurts.\n"},{"id":4,"href":"/posts/2022-12-05_what_i_like_in_a_coding_font/","title":"What I Like in a Font for Code","section":"Technical Blog","content":" I\u0026#39;m well aware that I may have a bit of an obsession with fonts. I don\u0026#39;t think that\u0026#39;s too unusual for someone who works in tech, however. Sites like Programming Fonts exist to let people test drive and compare a bunch of different fonts. Just for fun, I thought I\u0026#39;d write up some of the features I look for in a programming font that I\u0026#39;ve come to deliberately pick out.\nCritical letter forms: i, I, l, 1; o, O, 0 These are probably the most important letters to get write in any font that\u0026#39;s meant to be hyper-legible: lowercase l must be easily distinguishable from an uppercase I or the number 1, and the lowercase i should stand out nicely as well.\nI like to foot of the lowercase l to be curved to more easily distinguish it from the number 1. For example, this is what the letters look like in my Iosevka Output build:\nI find that that helps readability. I go back and forth as to whether or not I like the foot of the lowercase i to be likewise curved. My current font doesn\u0026#39;t have that set, but I used to configure Input Mono to work like that.\nZeros must be distinct from capital O. That\u0026#39;s usually pretty easy for a coding font to get right. I personally like the slash—I think that\u0026#39;s what I grew up with. Nothing wrong with a dot though.\nIncreased pickiness: a, g I like double-storey a and g rather than their simpler counterparts. A single-storey a looks a little too much like a lowercase o, and I find the g without two loops looks too much like a lowercase y.\nWidth Narrow fonts appeal to a lot of people. I don\u0026#39;t get it, however. I like how gentle an extended font is on the eyes. One of the reasons why I liked Input Mono so much was because it had nice, comfy, wide characters. Compare the readability:\nNormal Narrow I find the wider font to be much more readable.\nLigatures Nope. Just nope. I like to see exactly what characters are in my files.

Yikes!\nI once had to take my laptop to get some repairs done. The TAB key on my 2016 MacBook Pro had started glitching, and that wasn\u0026#39;t going to fly when I was working on code and needed my tab completions and app switching to be seamless. I took my laptop to the Apple-authorized repair service at my school. The surly technician confirmed my warranty and asked me to fill out an intake form for my computer.\nOne of the fields on that form was for the root password to my computer. I noted that this form wasn\u0026#39;t going to be encrypted, and so I declined to give the password to decrypt my hard drive. (To be honest, even if I could have somehow verified that the form were going to be stored securely, I wouldn\u0026#39;t have given up the password.) The technician got a little huffy and said that they needed to be able to run diagnostics to make sure everything was done correctly, etc. This was hard to believe, since it was a hardware problem that could be handled without any software intervention. I refused again; I told them (and wrote in the notes field of the form for any other support technicians) that I worked nearby and could come enter my password if needed within two minutes of getting a call.\nThe technician didn\u0026#39;t like that, but I was insistent. Eventually they relented. I didn\u0026#39;t have to give up my password and the repairs were completed without any problems. I was never called to input my password. I doubt something nefarious would have happened at that campus repair shop, but you never know.\nThere\u0026#39;s too much on your hard drive that cannot leak: information about your bank, access to your email, saved passwords, photos, journal entries, etc. Never surrender your password. There may be times when there is a legitimate need for the master password to run some diagnostics, but you should if at all possible be present to put that password in yourself and monitor closely what is done with your hardware.

There\u0026#39;s a ton of literature about continuations; this is just a simple example meant to showcase something small and hopefully grokkable.\nYou will need to understand a little bit of Racket, but if you know any Scheme, that should be good enough. If you just want a quick primer, check out Learn X in Y minutes for Racket.\n#lang racket ;;; Export these symbols (provide fail pick non-deterministic-factor) ;;; Global stack of choices (only visible to this module) (define *choices* \u0026#39;()) ;;; Pop a value off of the alternate choices stack (define (fail) (if (null? *choices*) #f (let ([next-choice (car *choices*)]) (set! *choices* (cdr *choices*)) (next-choice)))) This next function pick is where we capture the continuation. I\u0026#39;ve named it return-from-pick to illustrate that when you call this function, it will jump back to the point in the code where pick returns. However, this works even if you use the continuation after the thing the called pick itself has returned.\nInternally, the continuation is basically stack + program counter. It answers the question \u0026#34;where does this value go to when I return it?\u0026#34;\nWe \u0026#34;install\u0026#34; the continuation by calling it like a function. It\u0026#39;s a first-class value, though, so we can save it in a closure on a stack and call it as many times as we want.\n(define (pick vals) (if (null? vals) (fail) ; fallback if there\u0026#39;s nothing to choose (let ([my-choice (car vals)]) ; pick something (let/cc return-from-pick ; capture the continutation right here! ;; Push the rest of the options into the *choices* stack (for ([other-choice (cdr vals)]) (set! *choices* (cons (λ () (return-from-pick other-choice)) *choices*))) ;; This is how we return from the `pick\u0026#39; function with a particular value. (return-from-pick my-choice))))) Now we have to use our operator. Let\u0026#39;s write a factoring function that non-deterministically picks a factor. We test it to make sure that the one we picked works, and if it did, we return it. Otherwise, we tell the computer that we fail ed.\n(define (non-deterministic-factor n) ;; Pick some factor, dunno which (let ([some-factor (pick (range 2 n))]) ;; Did we pick a factor? (if (zero? (modulo n some-factor)) some-factor ; yes we did! (fail)))) ; oops, that was the wrong one If you save those snippets into a file called amb.rkt and try running it, you should see something like:\n$ racket -it amb.rkt \u0026gt; (non-deterministic-factor 42) 2 \u0026gt; (fail) 21 \u0026gt; (fail) 14 \u0026gt; (fail) 7 \u0026gt; (fail) 6 \u0026gt; (fail) 3 \u0026gt; (fail) #f \u0026gt; (fail) #f ,quit $ Moral of the story: we just implemented McCarthy\u0026#39;s non-deterministic/ambiguous amb operator which picks some value, tries it out, then seemingly backtracks no matter the code to the point where the value gets picked if the fail function is ever invoked. Moreover, this was all implemented in userland: no special compiler constructs, no macros, no nuffin\u0026#39;.\nIn reality, what we did was we saved the stack and program counter just before we returned from pick with our choice. When we call fail, we reinstantiate that stack frame but return a different value. The program proceeds as if we had returned with that value in the first place. (Though note that changes on the heap or the file system, etc. will not be reverted. It\u0026#39;s only in side-effect free code that the illusion of time travel will be complete. You could stick a print statement in the fail function to see just how many times it gets called as the program searches for a path that doesn\u0026#39;t call fail.)\nContinuations can also be used to implement cooperative threading, job queues, and exception handling if you language doesn\u0026#39;t support those. In each case, you can extend the language with continuations and functions without the rest of the code having to worry about it. It\u0026#39;s a very powerful, robust, and non-leaky abstraction.\n"},{"id":7,"href":"/posts/2022-11-07_unix_philosophy/","title":"Unix as a tool forge","section":"Technical Blog","content":" Wikipedia1 cites a few different sources on what \u0026#34;Unix Philosophy\u0026#34; is. Peter Salus summarizes it as:\nWrite programs that do one thing and do it well. Write programs to work together. Write programs to handle text streams, because that is a universal interface. That second bullet point is my favorite: making composable programs rather than monolithic systems. In this way, Unix is designed to be a forge for easily building new tools. The first rule—writing programs that do one thing well—is largely a means to the second. When you have building blocks that take simple shapes, you can compose them easily like Lego pieces.\nI think that second goal is what makes Unix win: instead of providing you with every tool under the sun, you get a set of composable tools that allow you to construct better tools perfectly tailored to your problem. No one hacking on a PDP-11 thought to make an easy way to publish a blog like this one, but they put the framework in place to let me put together the tools I need to deploy this very post with a single command.\nHow Emacs fits inside of Unix philosophy One might argue that Emacs goes against Unix philosophy, for it can quite literally do pretty much everything.2 But that only violates the first rule—if you consider Emacs to be a tool forge, then Emacs is quite in line with the Unix philosophy. Emacs provides functions that all work on the buffer or bits of text, and these can all be composed to craft a work environment to fit your needs. I use over 100 different packages, and they all play nice together!\nI have come to view Emacs as my primary forge. It\u0026#39;s my layer on top of Unix, if you will. If I have Emacs customized how I like it, it doesn\u0026#39;t matter too much what operating system lives underneath: I can get a lot of work done. I used to view Emacs just as a tool, and I used it exclusively as a text editor. As time went on, though, I began to value the extreme keyboard-centric control Emacs gave me over my system. That\u0026#39;s why I moved from the terminal to the GUI version of Emacs: I wanted to have more modifiers available to bind functions to.\nMany people use Emacs exclusively as a text editor, and that\u0026#39;s fine. Usually these people have gotten comfortable with the command line, which is just another kind of tool forge. The great thing is both places make building new tools easy. Whatever your toolkit (though I do recommend you add Emacs to it if it\u0026#39;s not already there!) make sure you can build new tools with ease.\nFurther Reading Discussion on Hacker News A kind chap sent me a link to this blog post as well as their own thoughts, which seemed like good things to link to.

Even as hip new platforms like Slack \u0026amp;co. gain traction in the workplace, so much communication takes place in a crusty old medium that\u0026#39;s outlived every purported \u0026#34;email killer\u0026#34;. Where does it get its staying power from?\nEmail predates much of the Internet as we know it today. Its current incarnation first emerged in the early 80s, though it has roots in earlier forms of digital messaging from as far back as the 60s. \u0026#34;Email\u0026#34; is roughly three related protocols: SMTP, \u0026#34;Simple Mail Transfer Protocol\u0026#34;, which deals with the sending of mail; IMAP, or \u0026#34;Internet Message Access Protocol\u0026#34;, which allows mail clients to fetch mail; and POP3, or \u0026#34;Post Office Protocol\u0026#34;, an older mail fetching protocol largely superseded by IMAP.\nOne neat thing about email is that you don\u0026#39;t have to use a particular email client to send and receive messages: it doesn\u0026#39;t matter if you use Gmail\u0026#39;s web interface, their mobile app, or Thunderbird, or Apple\u0026#39;s built-in email program, or even text-based mail clients like mutt—everyone can still talk to each other.\nMoreover, different email clients have different strengths: Gmail, for instance, is so simple that your grandma can (and probably does) use it to send you pictures or reminders about the family reunion next weekend. Academics, who typically have to deal with overwhelming heaps of emails, can use keyboard-driven mail clients to digest all these messages. (See Nicolas P. Rougier\u0026#39;s mu4e-dashboard package for an example of what some academics do.)\nThe point: email derives its staying power from how the common platform (SMTP, IMAP) is decoupled from how one interacts with it. (mail clients) It is malleable and ubiquitous, and everyone can adapt it for their needs.\nOutlook is faux email I\u0026#39;m starting a new position as a research assistant at the University of Utah, and I\u0026#39;m elated to be here. However, the university is pushing everyone to use their MS Outlook email system, and they\u0026#39;ve disabled SMTP and IMAP access. The mail client that I use (mu4e for those wondering) is built to work with these common, decades-old standards of IMAP and SMTP. I can\u0026#39;t use the built-in OS\u0026#39;s mail client or (heaven forbid) the web client nearly as effectively.\nI\u0026#39;ll be trying some work-arounds, but I\u0026#39;m not optimistic that anything will be resolved in the near future. So for now I\u0026#39;m stuck using the mail client provided by my operating system for work-related email. It\u0026#39;s really a shame because some brilliant Emacs users have made managing email pleasant and effective.\nWhy would the university block the tools that I need to do my job effectively? I have a theory on that.\nThe theory of two companies This also goes by the name \u0026#34;staff and line\u0026#34;.\nInside every organization there are two smaller companies: company 1 and company 2.\nCompany 1 is concerned with the product of the organization. In a tech firm for instance, company 1 is usually made up of engineering, product, sales, and marketing. (Broadly speaking.) In a university, company 1 is the faculty who are there to teach and do research.\nCompany 2 is concerned with running the organization. In a tech firm, this includes IT, HR, middle management, etc. In a university, company 2 is comprised of the staff and administration.\nThe primary job of company 2 is to support company 1\u0026#39;s operations. However, as is the nature with any large system, company 2 often begins to put some of its priorities over those of company 1\u0026#39;s. I saw this happen in a tech company I left a few years ago when management mandated that developers track the time they spent on each ticket in our scrum waterfall system down to the minute. This wasn\u0026#39;t a move that helped the developers in any way—this was just for management to feel like they had some better control of the situation.\nLikewise with university email: no one I know would elect to use Outlook as their email platform. It seems the university administration has deemed it better to force everyone into a closed system to avoid the potential of lawsuits. It helps the university as an organization, but it gets in the way of the faculty\u0026#39;s work.\nI get nervous when company 2 starts putting its priorities over company 1\u0026#39;s. To some extent it\u0026#39;s necessary, but it can be a slippery slope into bureaucratic paralyzation.\n"},{"id":10,"href":"/posts/2022-08-11_til_vertical_monitors/","title":"Today I learned: Vertical monitors and subpixel anti-aliasing","section":"Technical Blog","content":" Something I learned today from a coworker: if you turn your monitor sideways, subpixel anti-aliasing gets completely broken.

(Described below.) It uses a fusion of type inference algorithms from PLAI, ESP, and μKanren. (See Resources)\nBroadly speaking, our type inference engine works by:\ngenerating typing constraints from the program solving those constraints We\u0026#39;ll describe each of those in more detail.\nLanguage description We implement a really simple language that includes features such as the following:\n42 ; numeric literals #t ; booleans (let (x 1) (+ x 1)) ; single-variable let; binary math operators (λ y (+ y 2)) ; single-argument anonymous functions (let (id (λ x x)) (if (id #t) (id 2) (id 3))) ; let-polymorphism; conditionals At time of writing, the let-polymorphism works though it\u0026#39;s still a little rough.\nType checking vs type inference Type checking a step in language implementation where type annotations supplied by the user are mechanically checked prior to compiling or execution. Any time when the checker can determine that a value of the wrong type flows to a place (e.g. a variable, argument to a function, etc) it is called a type error.\nType inference saves programmers from having to write out all type annotations. Most times (though not always) it is possible to infer what the type of a variable should be. Literal values are really easy, for example:\nlet foo = 42; The variable foo clearly should have some kind of integer type. However, type inference is more powerful than just inferring variable types from their initial values; for example, consider this Rust snippet:\nlet add_1 = |x| x + 1; // (lambda x: x + 1) for you Python programmers What should type should the variable x have? Well, we know that it gets passed to +, so definitely some numeric type. Although the programmer doesn\u0026#39;t explicitly annotate the parameter x with its type here, we can tell using information elsewhere in the program. This is the role of type inference.\nWhy do we care about type inference? Type inference saves us a lot of typing. Moreover, if we are trying to retrofit a type system onto an existing system that has a lot of code written in it already, it would be nice to not have to require users of the language to go back and annotate all their existing code. We can still report type errors as we find them—they would have been caught at runtime anyway—ideally, existing code should just work, and future code should turn out safer.\nConstraint generation What are constraints? Constraints are statements about what how types and bits of a program relate to each other. For example, here is a little program with some constraints illustrated:\nA little Rust program with some type relationships illustrated. Even though none of the variables have explicit type annotations, we know that x must be some kind of number, add_1 is a function ℕ→ℕ, and y_plus_1 must be a number because it\u0026#39;s the same as the return value as add_1. Moreover, whatever y is, it has to match the input type of add_1 as well.\nHow do we generate constraints? At time of writing, we only have equality constraints, which state that some particular expression must have the same type as another type expression. Later we will likely add subtype constraints or union constraints which will involve some form of back-tracking.\nOur algorithm walks through the AST of a program and emits a list of constraints on particular points of the AST. Please see one of the listed Resources for more details.\nMost explanations (PLAI, EPL) of a type inference algorithm dump the generated constraints into a set. Here we diverge somewhat from the literature: we gather the constraints into a list, which keeps the constraints in rough order of when we encountered those constraints in the program. This ordering is important for good error generation later on.\nWe will likely play with how these constraints are ordered in the future.\nA good excerpt from PLAI:\nWhat are constraints? They are simply statements about the types of expressions. In addition, though the binding instances of variables are not expressions, we must calculate their types too (because a function requires both argument and return types). In general, what can we say about the type of an expression?\nThat it is related to the type of some identifier. That it is related to the type of some other expression. That it is a number. [/Or in the case of this interpreter, that it is a boolean./] That it is a function, whose domain and range types are presumably further constrained. Unification We use ideas from the unify algorithm in μKanren: we have a walk function along with a substitution list that we can modify non-destructively. This differs from how PLAI and EPL describe unify, which often does destructive replacement of variables in the substitution list.\nI think this algorithm has the benefit of being a little simpler to understand, once the purpose of the walk function is grokked. It does mean that you must invoke (walk ast-chunk substitution-list) in order to find the type of the AST node.\nSee the infer-and-annotate and patch-annotations functions for a demonstration of how the substitution list along with the original tagged AST can be used to get the type for every node in the program.\nConstructed types, or higher-order types Our simple language doesn\u0026#39;t have (yet) types like (listof ℕ), but it could if we wanted to let it. Use function calls as a model for how we would handle these cases. From PLAI:\nWe have used numbers as a stand-in for all form of base types; functions, similarly, stand for all constructed types, such as listof and vectorof.\nError message generation Our error message generator is sensitive to the order in which type constraints are eliminated during the unification process: we generate the constraints in rough order of when the type of something would be encountered. E.g., when evaluated the form (+ 1 2), we generate the constraints for the literal values 1 and 2, then we generate the numerical type constraint that + imposes on its arguments.\nThis seems to do a pretty good job of giving us the information we need.\nExtending the language Adding new forms to the language only involves modifying the constraint generation and error message production routines. (Along with a few ancillary functions like AST tagging etc.) The unify routine essentially stays the same.\nWhen we add type unions we will have to modify unify to support some form of back-tracking. We will also have to make some modifications with let polymorphism.\nOpen Tasks Basic type inference Decent error messages if and let forms Type unions let-polymorphism Occurrence typing for handling nullable types Resources PLAI Programming Languages: Application and Interpretation, Krishnamurthi.

Note that this is all to the best of my knowledge and understanding at the present time; if there be faults, they be the faults of myself. I welcome correction and clarification if I am wrong.\nLiveness vs. Safety # Liveness and safety deal with properties of a system. Contrast that with soundness and completion, which are adjectives about analyses.\nLiveness # A liveness property of a system is of the form \u0026ldquo;something good will eventually happen.\u0026rdquo; One example is eventual consistency in a concurrent system: we want to know that, after some finite number of steps, our system comes to a consistent state of the world.\nAnother example might be with a bank: I want it to be the case that when I move money between accounts, the correct amount of money makes it to the destination account. That is something we want to eventually happen, and that\u0026rsquo;s what makes it a liveness property.\nSafety # Safety is the dual of liveness: in contrast to liveness, a safety property states that \u0026ldquo;something bad does not occur\u0026rdquo;. One example of a safety property is in an operating system, nothing prevents the kernel from preempting a task. We never want to get stuck in a state where the kernel cannot regain control of the processor. If our operating system is safe in this regard, we know that we\u0026rsquo;ll never have the case where a program supersedes the kernel.\nExtending the bank analogy, a safety property might be that we never want money lost in a transaction. The program might occasionally fail to deliver money, but no value is accidentally destroyed during a transfer.\nSoundness vs. Completeness # Soundness and completeness refer to whole systems that make some kind of decision, e.g. a type system or some kind of a static analysis.\nSoundness # From Wikipedia:\n[A]n argument is sound if it is both valid in form and its premises are true. Soundness also has a related meaning in mathematical logic, wherein logical systems are sound if and only if every formula that can be proved in the system is logically valid with respect to the semantics of the system.\nSoundness means the system is trustworthy. A sound type system, for example, will never tell you that a program is devoid of type errors when there are in fact type errors. Most type systems typically are sound. This means, however, that there are programs which may not contain a type error but that the type checker cannot prove to be devoid of errors.\nAnother term that may be used for soundness is correct. (Though, I believe, this may be highly context-dependent.)\nCompleteness # The dual of soundness: if a system is complete, it means the system can give an answer for every input. It might make some mistakes in reasoning. E.g. with a complete type system, there is no program which it cannot assign a type to (even if it\u0026rsquo;s a divergent type) but an assertion that a program is type-safe is not necessarily true.\nWhy can\u0026rsquo;t we have both soundness and completeness at the same time? Gödel is to blame for that.\n"},{"id":18,"href":"/posts/personal/2021-12-25_christmas/","title":"Christmas 2021","section":"Personal Blog","content":"It\u0026rsquo;s my first Christmas being a dad.

This is partially for me to record what things reduced friction for me as a student so that one day, should I become a professor, I\u0026rsquo;ll be able to run the lowest-friction class ever!\nSynopsis # The best classes made it easy for me to see a list of everything that was due, when it was due, and what each assignment entailed. Exhaustively-written lab write-ups hosted on GitHub were a highlight. The worst was when I found numerous typos in an assignment.\nDescription of what I like generally # I like loading all of my assignments into org-mode. If you\u0026rsquo;re not familiar with it, you can think of it as a programmable version of Markdown (though they\u0026rsquo;re not really related) that includes utilities for managing tasks, calendar items, notes, general markup (I write many of my school papers with org-mode) and even spread sheets!1 My school file looks something like this:\n#+TITLE: School #+FILETAGS: :school: #+TAGS: { general(g) cs_460 math_485 music_202 pws_100 research(r) } \\n { reading(b) homework(h) test(t) } * General * CS 460 :cs_460: ** DONE HW 1 - Set up DEADLINE: \u0026lt;2021-09-03 Fri 23:59\u0026gt; CLOSED: [2021-09-03 Fri 23:32] ** TODO HW 2 - Networks and Delay DEADLINE: \u0026lt;2021-09-10 Fri 23:59\u0026gt; (Description here) ... * MATH 485... * MUSIC 202... * PWS 100 You can see top-level headings for each of my classes with assignments as sub-headings marked with TODO or DONE.2 Org-mode will munge all the assignments and display them for me in a nice calendar view.\nOn mobile I use beorg which is hands-down the best org-mode agenda view for iOS. (Note: agenda view. This app is best for managing your todo lists. If you want to edit org-mode files when you\u0026rsquo;re using org-mode for markup, there are some other ones that work a little better for that purpose.)\nAt the beginning of each semester I usually load all the assignments I can see into my org-mode file. This always involves a good amount of Perl and Emacs macros. Once everything is set up, I almost never miss an assignment.\nThe Good # One class had most of the assignments loaded into a spreadsheet that we could download. Easily the shortest time I had to spend to get things into the format that I like. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t complete, however, so I had to update it once or twice.\nMy CS class had the class labs in a repository on GitHub. If the professor pushed out a change to the lab spec, we just had to pull the repo. If there was a typo, we could submit a PR. (There was one that I found, and my professor merged my pr!)\nSubmissions required using tar. (CS class, obviously, and the professor gave us instructions. I can, however, remember the flags.) Yum. Gimme that UNIX goodness.\nLate days: for one class we had a pool of 10 late days that we could apply to almost any assignment. (Exceptions were exams, which makes sense and we were provided ample clarification on that.) This was nice because it let me budget my time. I could choose to push off a lab to get a more pressing assignment for another class in.\nThe Bad # Typos in assignments. Goodness gracious, proofread your assignments! I got a .doc3 file that was riddled with typos. It was all simple stuff like \u0026ldquo;tranport\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;trasported\u0026rdquo; that a spell checker would have flagged immediately. The Ugly # Proctorio. My botany class used Proctorio and I am not cool with that. I talked to the professor about my concerns—he listened, but wasn\u0026rsquo;t willing to turn off Proctorio. My RSI has been better, but I still don\u0026rsquo;t like having to use a web-interface to enter text. I\u0026rsquo;d much rather type up my answers in Emacs and paste them in. I\u0026rsquo;m grateful that I had a Raspberry Pi that I could use to isolate the ickiness. Conclusion # It was a pretty good semester, all in all. It was my first semester as a father; my wife was also finishing up, so that made things difficult. We got a lot of help from our parents—especially my mother-in-law—and I owe them all a debt of gratitude for helping us make it through the semester.\nI also applied to grad schools! I might write more on that later. I\u0026rsquo;m glad to have that out of the way. Now the waiting begins…\nAppologies to org-mode. This is a pretty sorry description.

What drives this tension, however, is a particular view of technology and technological progress that exacerbates the problems the film focuses on. This mentality is called high modernist ideology by Scott in his book Seeing Like a State:\nWhat is high modernism, then? It is best conceived as a strong (one might even say muscle-bound) version of the beliefs in scientific and technical progress that were associated with industrialization in Western Europe and in North America from roughly 1830 until World War I. At its center was a supreme self-confidence about continued linear progress, the development of scientific and technical knowledge, the expansion of production, the rational design of social order, the growing satisfaction of human needs, and, not least, an increasing control over nature (including human nature) commensurate with scientific understanding of natural laws.\n(Scott, 89)\nNote that this is different from the literary definition of high modernism. For the purposes of this paper, high modernist ideology is understood as a belief that rational, scientific systems will solve all of mankind’s ailments. Metropolis is situated right at the tail end of the reign of high modernist ideology, and illustrates some of the failings of that mentality.\nIn this paper we will examine how Metropolis illustrates the dangers of high modernist thinking in how it portrays man’s subservient relationship to machinery and the fragility of the city of Metropolis resulting from top-down, rational planning. Ironically, even though these themes of centralized failure have been common place in film for more than a century now,1 the dream of a perfectly organized Utopia persists in our culture today. Metropolis therefore remains an important case study of the dangers and failings of high modernism.\nMan Serves the Machine # The opening of Metropolis shows a stark example of men working as slaves to the machine. Freder goes down to the lower levels to see how the workers live. He passes workers mechanically going from pose to pose to keep the machines running. Their jerky, repetitive motions cast the human workers merely as organic components of each machine that they tend.\nWhen Freder arrives at the M-Machine, he witnesses an explosion that kills or seriously maims several workers, all because one worker was unable to reach a particular valve in time. The machine was obviously not designed to be ergonomic and was lacking critical safety features that would have prevented such a devastating accident. The machine’s complexity and human-hostile design make accidents like this essentially inevitable. The massive requirements that the machines impose on the humans shows the high modernist idea that humans should submit themselves to rational ideas, and that human nature can be overcome by rational, technical means.\nYet this submission to rational, mechanical systems is in itself an irrational one. Freder’s vision of Moloch gobbling up workers who dutifully march into the gaping jaws of the machine speaks to the almost fanatic devotion certain planners of large systems had to rationality. The vision closes and Freder sees some workers wordlessly2 collecting the bodies of the injured and dead, whilst others take up their posts to keep the machine working. There’s some redundancy in how the human workers are allocated to account for mechanical failures or accidents, but there’s no redundancy in the machines to account for human failures.\nWe get other hints throughout the film of the submission of men to the machine. Metropolis looks to be absolutely unlivable. In the upper levels, we do see crowds gathered for entertainment and sport, but the city streets are either entirely devoted to automobiles, or are so foreboding and unwelcoming that no pedestrian-centric economy could ever flourish there. The streets are sterile and perfectly regular; the buildings are all blocks and perfectly featureless. This prefigures some of the architecture and city planning that was present during the DDR: massive apartment complexes built out of prefabricated concrete slabs were often placed far away from the city center, so as to make the Plattenbau districts feel stifling. The straight lines might look good on paper, but maps and city plans are of necessity a simplification over what real life looks like. Life flourishes in the hand-crafted and in the unique. Top-down imposed grids crush what makes life interesting and livable in the city.\nThe Fragility of Monoculture and Centralized Planning # After the accident at the M-Machine, Freder rushes to tell his father, the architect and ruler of Metropolis, about what he saw. In his office at the top of the New Tower of Babel, Jon Frederson controls the city from a central vantage point: aides digest and bring him information, while others record his decisions and carry out his orders. He is the very model of a high modernist: his rationality has brought order and prosperity to the citizens of the upper levels, and everyone above is free to spend their time as they please. It seems that the city is working perfectly well. However, Metropolis turns out to be very fragile.\nFrederson’s control begins unraveling when his aids fail to bring him the information that he wants, and continues when Rotwang plots against him. Eventually the city collapses when the striking workers’ protest goes further than he had foreseen. The destruction of the Heart Machine causes the lower levels of the city to flood and the upper levels to loose power. Cars halt in the streets, and elevators plummet down their shafts. The apparently well-ordered city with bumper-to-bumper cars moving smoothly down the streets suffers cardiac arrest: broken elevators and stopped cars hinder the protagonists as they try to reach safety.\nThis fragility has a good analogue from the mistakes of high modernist ideology. Scientific forestry came about in the 1700s in Germany as a way to improve lumber yield. A plot of forest would be cleared of all “junk” trees and underbrush, and new trees of a single species were planted in straight lines. The ground was cleared to make way for the saplings, and each year there was a neat rotation between different parcels of land from which mature wood could easily and quickly be harvested. Initially, this was a great success: the wood was strong, straight, and plentiful. There was no junk wood that interfered, and lumber outputs could be reliably predicted.\nIt was not, however, without its drawbacks. In a book published in 1986, Richard Plochmann describes how yields dropped after the first few batches (Lang and Pye). The reasons for the drop are complex, but the cause was simple: the “clean” forest that produced such predictable quantities of lumber was a monoculture: there was no variety to protect against a pest that targeted a single species of tree. The soil fauna that are critical to a flourishing forest died off, and the trees withered when they didn’t get the nutrients that they needed.\nOne of the hallmarks of high modernist ideology is that problems can be solved by large, complex systems, be they mechanical, political, or bureaucratic. Such aspirations usually fail to take account of the difficulties in getting complex systems to run for long periods of time without encountering significant failures. Metropolis vividly illustrates the fall of Jon Frederson’s pride as the fragility in the massive system he created causes everything to fail around him.\nMediation # Amidst the warnings of the dangers of high modernist ideology, the message of Metropolis is tentatively hopeful: “the mediator between the hands and the head must be the heart!” By the end of the movie, we see the robot masquerading as a human unmasked and destroyed, and the beginnings of greater understanding between the architect of the city, and those that are actually required to live in the city and maintain it. This ultimately is also the cure for high modernist ideology: the designers of complex systems must take into account the needs and the experiences of those who would suffer the brunt of its effects. Metropolis casts this lesson in the discourse of class struggle, but it can also apply to those who design cities, automobiles, software, and other systems.\nWorks Cited # Scott, James C.

At the most reduced level, one could say that a program\u0026rsquo;s behavior is defined by the effect it has on the hardware running it. That\u0026rsquo;s not very useful however; when we\u0026rsquo;re programming, we often have to deal with legacy code and tease out the original intent of the code.\nSaying that the meaning of a program is entirely encapsulated by the code is saying that the intent and the implementation are the same. They so rarely are!\nToday I found some Elixir code that looked like the following:\n@spec all_have_key?(lst :: [%{}], needed_key :: String.t()) :: boolean() def all_have_key?(lst, needed_key) do lst |\u0026gt; Enum.map(fn m -\u0026gt; m |\u0026gt; Map.keys() |\u0026gt; Enum.any?(fn k -\u0026gt; k == needed_key end) end) |\u0026gt; Enum.all?() end (Note, I just threw that together—possible syntax errors in there.)\nWhat is this code trying to do? It\u0026rsquo;s trying to check that each map in a list has a given key and return true or false on that condition. I don\u0026rsquo;t think the code even had a @spec to help explain that: all I had was the function name (which was not as clear as all_have_key) and the source.\nAfter a few moments of reflection, I rewrote it to this:\n@spec all_have_key?(lst :: [%{}], needed_key :: String.t()) :: boolean() def all_have_key?(lst, needed_key) do lst |\u0026gt; Enum.map(\u0026amp;Map.has_key?(\u0026amp;1, needed_key)) |\u0026gt; Enum.all?() end That big long complicated bit has a built-in function. The built-in function is more efficient because it doesn\u0026rsquo;t traverse the entire list of keys searching for a match: with a map, you get O(1) lookup time.\nSo what does a program mean? I\u0026rsquo;m pretty confident that I preserved the intended meaning of this program. But what\u0026rsquo;s a better way to express that intent?\nTests are useful, but they don\u0026rsquo;t capture everything. While I think this function was tested, no test can ever ensure 100% preservation of intent. Tests can only find witnesses of meaning mismatches.\nType systems are helpful too. But types come in varying degrees of precision: some languages give you an Int, while others give you Int or Nat or ∈ {1, 2, 3}. More powerful type systems let you express more of your intent in a way that can be mechanically checked, but they tend to also be more burdensome.\nThis is an open question that I know there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of ongoing research around. I\u0026rsquo;m excited to see what I find!\n"},{"id":22,"href":"/posts/2021-09-25_models_of_programming_draft2/","title":"Models of Programming","section":"Technical Blog","content":"Last week I was studying outside of a lecture hall where someone was teaching an introductory course on computer programming. There was a lot that I overheard that I disagreed with; this essay is an attempt to help me crystallize what exactly I disagreed with.\nWhat is programming? What is good programming? What should programming be like? How you answer depends a lot on what you value. What I value in programming has not always been the same, and I think I\u0026rsquo;m the better for having toured around the space a little bit. I recognize that there\u0026rsquo;s still a lot to explore; nonetheless, I present my admittedly limited perspective on some broad ways that people think about programming—especially in academia and pedagogy—and some of the strengths and weaknesses of each.\nOne way of thinking about programming is that you are ordering a computer to do your bidding: you, the programmer, sit at the helm of your CPU, afloat on a sea of data, and you have various levers and knobs that you can pull and twist to make the CPU get from point A to point B: load this value into memory slot i. Now add five to it. Now print that back out. Etc. This is called imperative programming, because you tell the computer every step it should take.\nI\u0026rsquo;m doubtful that there\u0026rsquo;s much deep insight into programming this way.1 It\u0026rsquo;s like writing a recipe for a horrendously unimaginative cook. If you\u0026rsquo;re teaching students how to program like this, they might get an appreciation for being detail-oriented and sweating the minutiae—that\u0026rsquo;s well and good—but I think that\u0026rsquo;s about where it stops.\nAnother way of thinking about programming is that you, the programmer, teach the computer to solve progressively more complicated problems by composing bits of behavior together. Programs start behaving more like the Fourier series: the aggregation of simple, easy-to-understand components yields a robust and flexible result.\nWhere it really starts getting interesting is when you bring more powerful programming languages into the mix: languages that let you do more than just give the computer a dumb set of instructions to dutifully and meticulously slog through. Languages like Scheme (and related languages like Racket, Clojure, and—I\u0026rsquo;d argue—Elixir) give you the tools to build up models of the problem you\u0026rsquo;re trying to solve. You begin to think about the fundamental nature of the problems at hand and how to proceed from there. Whereas in the first case, you\u0026rsquo;re more focused on how to get the computer to do something. Reversing your tack can lead you down a wrong path for a long time without you knowing it.\nBesides, high-level, functional programming languages make great pedagogical tools for more reasons than just the power they give you in modeling your program. Many of these languages put emphasis on building programs up from small, composable units with no side-effects that are easy to reason about, test, and put together. Not only do you learn how to sweat the details, you also learn how to orchestrate many simple pieces into complex solutions that fit the problem at hand. It\u0026rsquo;s the difference of being taught the rudiments of cooking and learning how to compose dishes that fit together into a complete meal meant to delight and nourish.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s some effort to achieve these ends when courses opt to focus on object-oriented principles. Sure, you learn about decomposing your problems along domain lines, but there\u0026rsquo;s often much more focus on mutation which can trip beginners up. Local-reasoning dissolves, and your layers of abstraction leak.\nFurthermore, OO is emphatically not a good fit for so many problems! Nevertheless, a great deal of effort has been expended by thousands of researchers to find \u0026ldquo;best-practice patterns\u0026rdquo; for each and every scenario. We\u0026rsquo;ve drifted back a little towards the rote recipe-following instruction. Abstract mathematics provides a much richer modeling domain—indeed, computability theory was born from the Lambda Calculus, and it has proved to be a very fruitful field for general modeling.\nAbstract mathematics isn\u0026rsquo;t a prerequisite to learning how to program (though it does turn out to be very useful the further one goes) but that doesn\u0026rsquo;t prevent us from teaching a more mathematically-oriented way of thinking about problem decomposition. There are many excellent books that do this, from the celebrated Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs by Abelson and Sussman to How to Design Programs by Felleisen et. al.\nMy hope is that programming courses in higher-education settings (and high school settings!) will move away from imperative and even object-oriented programming towards a more functional approach.\nLow-level knowledge # I\u0026rsquo;d like to qualify an earlier claim: imperative programming has little benefit from a pedagogical standpoint.2 Now, that\u0026rsquo;s not entirely true, because there comes a point where you need to know the low-level details of how a computer works, and assembly is an imperative language. C is a great language for learning systems programming, because it exposes you to all the nuts and bolts of memory, interrupts, system calls, etc. There are a lot of footguns in this area, and that\u0026rsquo;s because physics is a beast. I still don\u0026rsquo;t think it\u0026rsquo;s a good idea to start with this stuff, much like a budding chef doesn\u0026rsquo;t need to know the details of the chemical reactions taking place in the oven, but there comes a point where knowing the underlying chemistry becomes indispensable.\nNow, there\u0026rsquo;s a very wrong way to teach programming, and that way is by using something as ungainly as C++.\nC++ is a pedagogically worthless language. It bogs a budding student down with historical baggage like header files and cryptic imports whilst drowning said student in the complexities of an abuse and archaic syntax, with nothing but an error message that\u0026rsquo;s as clear and useful as a lead-filled balloon used as a flotation device. It\u0026rsquo;s impossible to get a pleasing, mathematically-sound model of your domain in C++. Heck, you can\u0026rsquo;t even model something in an OO way whilst following the literature on that. Almost all effort is consumed in attempting to appease a persnickety compiler.\nSince getting the syntax and the ceremony right is so much of C++, it turns into a guess-and-check game, where the student keeps tweaking things until it works. This is not the way. You don\u0026rsquo;t learn anything about why things are the way they are. This is similar to one argument I\u0026rsquo;ve heard about how Java suffers from a similar problem. We shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be teaching students how to solve programs in a given language. Rather, we should be giving them tools to think about the problems they face and how to solve them.\n(apply + essay) # The thing that set me off from that lecture was that the instructor was suggesting students use pass-by-reference in function calls without even mentioning the headache that can come from side-effects and breaking referential transparency in functions. It\u0026rsquo;s the kind of thing that a beginner doesn\u0026rsquo;t need to know to program, but misuse can lead to some really nasty bugs. Anyway, programming with mutation is better avoided—best not to encourage techniques that students will have to unlearn when they encounter a pure language.\nTo sum up, I think the best way to start out thinking about programming is by considering how to model problem domains as best as possible, and functional languages give you the most and best tools to do that with. OO is an improvement over imperative programming, but do not use C++!\nThere\u0026rsquo;s something there for sure… I\u0026rsquo;ll come back to this.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nSee, I told you I\u0026rsquo;d come back to it!\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n"},{"id":23,"href":"/posts/personal/2021-09-19_symbols/","title":"Reluctance to Bear a Symbol","section":"Personal Blog","content":"I feel uncomfortable with many symbols. I might have opinions about a subject, but there\u0026rsquo;s rarely a camp that has some symbol, flag, slogan, etc. that I\u0026rsquo;m comfortable with adopting because that camp does not accurately reflect my opinion. All too often, a slogan takes on more than its surface meaning, and that can make using that slogan tricky.\nA simple example is with politics. On certain topics I agree with whatever happens to be defined as the \u0026ldquo;conservative\u0026rdquo; viewpoint. On other issues, I favor the \u0026ldquo;liberal\u0026rdquo; opinion. I like some libertarian ideals, but I can\u0026rsquo;t agree with all of the \u0026ldquo;official\u0026rdquo; ones.\nEvery party, movement, or group comes up with some slogans that are either catchy or hard to refute. But these phrases are just symbols for broader ideas. An article from Persuasion summed it up nicely:\nTake, for example, Black Lives Matter. The slogan itself is (or at least should be) obvious and uncontroversially true. But there’s also a more substantive movement and political program behind BLM, which is rightfully more controversial.…\nWhether or not you agree with these goals, Black Lives Matter clearly means more to most activists than “black people’s lives matter.”\nThe danger with using slogans as \u0026ldquo;reasoning\u0026rdquo; is that they\u0026rsquo;re shallow: they\u0026rsquo;re inherently short, snippy, and difficult to attack. Arguing with a set of slogans is like trying to fight an image projected on fog. There\u0026rsquo;s no substance to meaningfully engage with, and then proponents of that movement will call you out for fighting against these \u0026ldquo;uncontrollably true\u0026rdquo; ideas.\nBesides, it\u0026rsquo;s way better to agree with ideas, not parties. Picking a party based on a few things you like about it, and then agreeing with the rest is like saying you like a particular food you\u0026rsquo;ve never eaten before, just because it has one or two ingredients that you like. I like mustard, but I\u0026rsquo;m not going to eat a cake that includes mustard.\nIdeas don\u0026rsquo;t compress well, if at all. Ideas can be simple, but trying to compress simple ideas leads to simplistic understanding. Life is inherently messy, and slogans and memes are simplifications on top of that messiness.\nIn place of a well-reasoned argument, political activists can lean on pithy memes to demonstrate their political allegiances. But when people use memes as a shortcut, they sacrifice the process of testing and inspecting their opinions. Insight comes from challenging ideas, and memes allow people to skirt this process.\n(ibid.)\nI recommend reading that Persuasion article. Don\u0026rsquo;t let slogans and memes be an intellectual shortcut. Embrace the nuance and messiness of this world, and learn to come to terms with it.\n"},{"id":24,"href":"/posts/2021-08-21_racket_mug/","title":"A programmable programming language?

My baby has reached the point where she\u0026rsquo;s too tired to sleep. She alternates between screaming at 90+ decibels and sleeping fitfully. She only transfers from the crying state to the sleep state after prolonged, labored rocking and soothing. She transfers back to the base crying state on her own after a few seconds.\nI still love her. I just don\u0026rsquo;t appreciate her as much during these times.\nOne thing that I\u0026rsquo;ve learned while watching my baby grow a little bit is just how hard keeping yourself alive is. My body is big enough that it can regulate food and water intake—feeding cycles are on the order of 5 hours instead of 2. Even then I can easily go 24 hours without eating anything if I choose. I can force myself to rest in bed, if not fall asleep. My baby can\u0026rsquo;t do any of that.\nOver the past few years I\u0026rsquo;ve had to be more careful with how I take care of myself. I know the warning signs of excessive sugar consumption, and I\u0026rsquo;ve learned to value avoiding the sugar headaches over whatever pleasure the treat provides. I\u0026rsquo;ve had to take a lot of care of my hands recently: I know the signs of RSI, and there\u0026rsquo;s so much I have to do to avoid another flare-up.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve found that regular running helps my hands stay happy. I guess the increased blood flow with the cardio helps them heal and be more resistant. I have to make sure I stay hydrated. I used to treat my hands very gingerly, but they\u0026rsquo;ve healed to the point where it\u0026rsquo;s better for me to exercise more with my hands. (Push-ups, etc.)\nHealthy food is so important too. That requires a lot of long-term planning and thinking, which is something that\u0026rsquo;s difficult for me. For some reason thinking about and planning around food is not something my brain likes to do. Compilers? Easy. Casserole? Not so much. But it has a tremendous impact on how well I can think, sleep, and act. My wife is a lifesaver in this regard; she loves to think about food and has steadily improved our diet.\nI can\u0026rsquo;t wait for my baby to learn how to sleep through the night. Every further step of independent self-regulation will be an exciting (and welcome!) one.

It\u0026rsquo;s most often needed in cases where you have some kind of dynamic dispatch: either where you have first-class functions or when you have objects and you call one of their methods.\nImagine for a moment that you were given a program which you were asked to analyze manually. You might start by going to the top of the program, running through each branch, and keeping track of the values variables could take. If the program is too complex to hold entirely in your head, you might start by writing down some abstractions to simplifiy remembering. For example, instead of remembering that the variable x holds the value of 12, you might just remember that it is a number. Thus, when you saw some assignment to x, such as x := x + 1, you could skip over that and just think that x is still a number.\nIf you came across a loop, you probably wouldn\u0026rsquo;t trace each execution through the loop: just one or two passes would be enough to tell you some interesting facts. For example:\ni := 0 while i \u0026lt; 10 { i++ print \u0026#34;i is {i}\u0026#34; } For a simple loop like this, it\u0026rsquo;s easy to show how the program will always make progress and complete the loop. For more complicated loops, proving progress might be impossible. (It might also be wrong: we do get programs with infinite loops.)\nIn these cases, we can just check to see if we\u0026rsquo;ve returned to a state that\u0026rsquo;s identical to a state that we\u0026rsquo;ve seen before: if x was a number, it should still be a number, etc. If the variables\u0026rsquo; (abstract) values are the same, we can conclude that there might be a loop and move on. It\u0026rsquo;s not guaranteed to be accurate, but it is a strategy that\u0026rsquo;s guaranteed to terminate.1\nThere\u0026rsquo;s more to CFA than what I\u0026rsquo;ve outlined here, but this should give you an idea. Stay tuned for more!\nThis is the classic completeness/consistency trade-off introduced by Kurt Gödel. A consistent evaluation of a program leaves in a state where there are programs that we cannot compute because we can\u0026rsquo;t tell if they halt. (The Halting Problem) A complete analysis, which is what we are interested in here, must sacrifice on consistency, and return inaccurate, though still useful results.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n"},{"id":28,"href":"/posts/personal/2021-06-13_this_shall_pass/","title":"This Too Shall Pass","section":"Personal Blog","content":"It\u0026rsquo;s cliché at this point to say that 2020 was a rough year. I\u0026rsquo;m grateful in that I and my wife were relatively unscathed by the pandemic. I had some personal health issues however that by themselves made 2020 a bit of a struggle. I learned some important lessons.\nIn February I had a big choir concert. That same weekend I had a large project for one of my CS classes due. I got an extension on my CS project so I could sing in the concert; but despite the extension, I was rushed and I spent an unusually long time in front of my computer working on my project after the concert was over.\nDue to the nature of the project, I had to use a mouse for much of it. The strain of pronation1 for such a long time did something in my right forearm. The next day I felt an ache every time I tried to turn my hands downward: even with a 15° tent on my split keyboard, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t lay my hands down to type. I felt a burning along the inside of my forearm whenever I tried. My grip was shot as well: I wasn\u0026rsquo;t able to open any tight jars, and I had to use my left hand for a lot of things that I normally would use my right hand for.\nI, at age 23, had developed a repetitive-strain injury.\nI went to a physical therapist. An ultrasound revealed no issues with my nerves. I was really happy about that because it meant that I didn\u0026rsquo;t need surgery. But I did need some non-surgical intervention: after many weeks of rest from work and several visits to a physical therapist, my hand started feeling a little better.\nAfter a month or so I was able to start going back to work. I started at working a few hours here and there, and over the course of a few months scaled back up to something close to what my hours normally were. I was extra-vigilant in doing my stretches and exercises that I had gotten from the physical therapist. Things were looking up.\nThen it started hurting again.\nIt didn\u0026rsquo;t take much: just a small deviation from my workout and a little added stress on my hands sent me back to the doctor. Some more deep-muscle massages and another break from work helped me to get back on track. But I was feeling shaken and a little depressed.\nThis cycle happened again a few more times. Each time, I wondered if I would ever be back to \u0026ldquo;normal\u0026rdquo; when I didn\u0026rsquo;t have to worry so much about my hands.\nI had been on the mend for a while and was feeling pretty happy about where I was. I invested in a new split keyboard that had more buttons for my thumbs which took the strain off of my pinky fingers. I switched to Vim-bindings in Emacs2 and made a concerted effort to avoid the mouse.\nThen I started running.\nI found a trail close by to where I live: it\u0026rsquo;s shady and pretty level. Running had always been my least favorite form of exercise, but I discovered that I actually enjoyed it.\nAfter just a few days, I noticed that my hands were feeling better than they ever had before. I think the cardio helped my hands get some more blood that they had been missing. My hands still feel great. Some days I don\u0026rsquo;t think about the fact that they were injured, which is a miracle.\nThen, after my first 5k, I got a bad case of runner\u0026rsquo;s knee.\nI\u0026rsquo;m still feeling it. It\u0026rsquo;s been a few days, and even walking has been has been a little painful. I think I pushed it too hard too quickly. I\u0026rsquo;m not great at this physical training thing.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve lost (temporarily) the form of exercise that I was just starting to enjoy. But something that I\u0026rsquo;ve learned from cycles of health and injury is that bad times come… and they also go. In the case of my hands, it took well over a year for me to feel like I was in a more normal place. I still feel like I\u0026rsquo;m on the mend—I still have a hard time using the keyboard on my laptop—but I\u0026rsquo;m optimistic that this time the worst is behind me, at least for the next few years.\nI\u0026rsquo;m still young, and I\u0026rsquo;m only just getting used to the idea that injuries don\u0026rsquo;t heal as well as they do when you\u0026rsquo;re a kid. It\u0026rsquo;s been a bit of a struggle to come to grips with that idea, but I\u0026rsquo;m getting there.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s always the best of times, as well as the worst of times. I\u0026rsquo;ve watched my wife, parents, and friends go through similar seasons of difficulty—sometimes spanning years of distress—only to emerge triumphant in some cases, or adapt when the difficulties never pass fully.\nI believe there is hope.

Didn\u0026rsquo;t seem to hurt things though.)\nAfter you\u0026rsquo;re done installing the u-boot-rpi4 package, you will want to copy a file from your FreeBSD machine to something you can use to modify the SD card. (In my case, I used the same machine as the one I used to flash the SD card in the first place.)\nme@non-freebsd:~ $ rsync -aivz root@generic:/usr/local/share/u-boot/u-boot-rpi4/u-boot.bin . (NOTE: If you want to use rsync, you\u0026rsquo;ll have to install rsync on your FreeBSD machine with pkg install rsync)\nShut down your Raspberry Pi, pull out the SD card, and mount it onto that machine you just copied the u-boot.bin file to. Open up the MSDOSBOOT image, and find the u-boot.bin file in the root of the image. Delete it, and move the one you copied from your pi into its place. Eject the SD card, and replace it into your Pi.

I\u0026rsquo;m using it right now to compose this post. I use it every single day for everything from work to school to personal notes. Most of my activity on GitHub comes from me tweaking little things in my configuration files. I now have an editor that perfectly fits my hands. Emacs is a big part of my life.\nI\u0026rsquo;m afraid it\u0026rsquo;s dying.\nRichard Stallman, one of the principle creators of Emacs and the head of the GNU Project, has made several choice in the past several months that I consider to be detrimental to the Emacs community and harmful for Emacs\u0026rsquo; further growth. RMS doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem to care that much about making Emacs appealing to new users, and I think this is a mistake. Emacs derives its strength from being uniquely customizable and extensible; the more people we get using Emacs, the more good extensions, packages, tutorials, etc. will be available for Emacs. Some of the growth-hostile things include:\nShutting down suggestions for making Emacs start with a sensible set of defaults that would make it significantly easier for beginners to get started1 Purging links to the most popular (and most useful!) Emacs package repositories, Melpa and Marmalade, just because they might contain links to sites with non-free Javascript2 Ignoring community-driven development and exercising veto rule in cases where I personally think it was unwarranted3 I can appreciate strong leadership; I think for creating most things, having a single leader drive the development of a product gives it focus and direction that otherwise might kill it off. (I think Python is a good example of this at work.) In this case with Emacs, however, I think RMS is badly out of touch and should focus on what we as a community can do to make Emacs more robust so that future generations of programmers will have a strong motivation to use Emacs—a desire to run free software motivates precious few people in their selection of their tools. We should make it more appealing for its features and performance as well.\nSome areas where Emacs stands to improve are:\nBeginner-friendliness The default Emacs theme looks awful. No computer user used to the comforts of macOS or Windows would want to go near that ugly beast. It should have a pretty-looking theme by default. One idea would be to make it so that a new user can select some pre-built themes. Performance There are some exciting things happening with gccemacs on this front. I\u0026rsquo;m not running that right now, as compiling Emacs master on macOS is a little persnickety. Improving its rendering engine would help too. I recognize that that is a big undertaking, and unfortunately I have little to offer in this regard. Ease of contribution Why not host Emacs development on a self-hosted GitLab instance? Or use some other issue tracker? I understand that there are some advantages for mailing lists, but the set of programmers who are a.) familiar with that work flow, and b.) prefer it, is dwindling. An issue/PR-style flow makes a lot more sense for most developers, and I think it would go a long way to enriching community involvement in Emacs\u0026rsquo; core development. These are just my thoughts, and will likely evolve over time. Unfortunately I cannot devote as much time as I would like to improving Emacs, though I do enjoy learning to write packages when I have the time.\nGood luck, all you Emacs maintainers out there.

If you can, watch it.\nHaving read Technopoly by Neil Postman, I didn\u0026rsquo;t feel like The Social Dilemma was revelatory in saying that technologies have unintended side-effects. What\u0026rsquo;s different about The Social Dilemma is that it is really accessible and it highlights real, present, concrete problems caused by Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc. (I think if Neil Postman had been alive to witness Facebook and Twitter, he would have been scared silly.)\nSocial media is perhaps unique in that there has never been a technology so complex that requires so little effort or expertise on the part of the end-user. Prior to the invention of the personal computer, the most complex piece of technology a lay person used was a car. Even though it is relatively easy to drive, a car still requires you to have some knowledge of its inner workings: knowing when to change the oil or coolant or when to get the tires replaced or the brakes checked is part of operating a car successfully.\nNot so with social media. All you need to know is how to type your name and scroll. The complexity behind Facebook\u0026rsquo;s implementation is orders of magnitude greater than that in any car. Yet Facebook is so easy to use that even the most illiterate, technologically inept person can figure it out. Therein lies some of the danger: Facebook, Google, Instagram, etc. all employ technologies1 to influence your behavior, and end users are entirely oblivious to their workings and effects.\nSo what do we do?\nAt the end of The Social Dilemma, many of the experts and creators of these technologies suggested that we need governmental regulation. I\u0026rsquo;m persuaded that our best bet lies in some kind of regulation, because market forces do nothing to incentivize their creators to fix the problems of polarization and misinformation. Exactly how that regulation should be enacted is an open question. Perhaps social media should be regulated like alcohol or tobacco: e.g. stricter limits on when someone can start using it, and visible warnings about the psychological effects that it has. Removing or severely curbing political advertisements, especially when paid for by parties other than the candidate in question, might have an interesting effect as well.\nAs for myself, I\u0026rsquo;ve gotten off of Facebook entirely. I\u0026rsquo;ve taken conscious steps to make it more difficult for me to get on Twitter. When I sleep, my phone is in a different room. Whenever I notice myself reaching for an app when I have nothing to do, I turn it off, delete it, or otherwise force myself to be more deliberate about my technology habits.\nWhen I have kids, I intend on acquainting them with the workings of computers and algorithms. While I don\u0026rsquo;t expect (or want) all of my kids to become computer scientists, I want them all to be aware of the mechanisms at play to help them be on their guard for addictive and manipulative technologies like social media.\nI am deeply worried about where things are going, and I do not think the solution to misinformation and polarization is more technology or AI or some other technological solution. It cannot be. They can help if employed correctly, but they cannot function as the cure. I think the only possible solutions will come from better regulation to shift the incentives of these massive technology companies and better education so that people can be more mindful, more deliberate, and less vulnerable to addiction or deception.\nNote that \u0026ldquo;technology\u0026rdquo; is more than a physical device. Technology includes things like writing or a mathematical formula.

I didn\u0026rsquo;t know what that meant at the time, but I soon found out.\nFor several anniversaries thereafter, my elementary school class would spend a minute of silence in remembrance of those who died. Each year I learned more about what happened—not just about the hijackings, but also how the nation came together for a few weeks afterwards. People tell me there was a profound, nation-wide sense of mourning, community, and shared strength.\nAbout 3,000 people died, and 25,000 were injured.\nOur nation is in the grips of a pandemic that kills that same number every three days. There is a difference between a plane wielded like a bomb and a mindless virus, but the profound dismissal and denial of our present crisis by the current president is criminal. He has utterly failed to unite the nation. He has shown no sympathy for the hundreds of thousands of people who have died. Had he acted better in February—and he knew what was coming—he might have been able to say he saved some.\nNow the blood of thousands is on his hands.\nHe has sought to direct attention away from an ongoing crisis in an effort to improve his appearance.

This is a little bunker built on top of the fortress. This is what the sign says:\nIn the year 1680 40 people died of the plague at the fortress.

We gain much through technology, but it comes at a price; all too often we are blind to that price. This book seeks to call attention to the costs of a technology-focused society. I felt this poignantly because I, as a technology worker, know what that infatuation feels like.\nThis book review will be pretty limited in scope: I\u0026rsquo;ll only talk about new insights that I got from the book, as well as a few points that I disagreed with. I encourage everyone to read the book: the book itself will do a much better job of telling you what it\u0026rsquo;s about than I will! This post, then, should be regarded as an artifact of me trying to make sense of what I read, rather than a comprehensive analysis of the book.\nBook Introduction # For those of you who haven\u0026rsquo;t yet read Technopoly, this section is a meager summary of some of the points I\u0026rsquo;ll touch on\nWhat is \u0026ldquo;technology\u0026rdquo;? # Technology is defined rather broadly in Technopoly: rather than just physical tools, a technique or a system can be considered a technology. For example, writing is a technology. In chapters 6–8 he talks about medical and computer technologies, as well as \u0026ldquo;invisible\u0026rdquo; technologies like statistics and writing.\nTechnology is usually intended to serve a particular purpose: writing lets us communicate without the need to be temporally and physically proximate. Statistics help us make sense of a complex world. Technologies give us benefits. What Postman explores is what technologies take away.\nPostman doesn\u0026rsquo;t say that technology is bad per se, and his argument isn\u0026rsquo;t that we should stop using certain technologies. Rather, he argues that we need to step back and be more conscientious in our usage:\n[We should understand] that technology must never be accepted as part of the natural order of things, that every technology—from an IQ test to an automobile to a television to ac computer—is a product of a particular economic and political context and carries with it a program, and agenda, and a philosophy that may or may not be life-enhancing and that therefore require scrutiny, criticism, and control.\npp. 184–185\nOur culture is not inclined to think about what we loose by adopting a particular technology. Why should it? To say that a particular technology comes with some costs (besides those of a pecuniary nature) doesn\u0026rsquo;t sell well. Moreover, most of us are just flat-out blind to the costs of technology.\nWhat does technology do? # Postman outlines three broad effects of technology:\nTechnology restructures our interests: a tool or technique might change what we might think about. Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, etc. can make us more interested in creating engaging or entertaining content, rather than quality work.\nTechnology changes our symbols: technology can change how we think about things—it can reassign value and change how we perceive the world. Bureaucracies often push for greater efficiency because efficiency is perceived as intrinsically good.\nTechnology alters our community: Twitter is a great example of how technology alters the arena in which ideas are created and debated. But this happened even before the internet: the telegraph brought together disparate parts of the world and blended their conversations.\nThe Value Shift # What I found most interesting in Postman\u0026rsquo;s book is his exploration of how technology can alter our values. He\u0026rsquo;s careful to point out that a change in values is not necessarily bad—some values need adjustment—but what is problematic is that we might not recognize what values are shifting.\nTo clarify what values are shifting, Postman writes:\nThese include the beliefs that the primary, if not the only, goal of human labor and thoughts is efficiency; that technical calculation is an all respects superior to human judgment; that in fact human judgment cannot be trusted, because it is played by laxity, ambiguity, and unnecessary complexity; that subjectivity is an obstacle to clear thinking; that what cannot be measured either does not exist or is of no value; and that the affairs of citizens are best guided and conducted by experts.\npp. 51 (emphasis mine)\nThe ramifications of this are multifaceted; I cannot hope to go into them all here. Instead, I\u0026rsquo;ll give one example of this shift at work: Facebook.\nFacebook\u0026rsquo;s premise is stupid # Facebook bills itself as a social network. I take issue with the social bit of that moniker. Human connection does not happen in a virtual world. Our species has been forming communities for millennia by getting together in the real world. Facebook wanting to help \u0026ldquo;create connection\u0026rdquo; is a solution in search of a problem.\nFacebook isn\u0026rsquo;t the only company that makes a big deal out of these kinds of \u0026ldquo;innovations\u0026rdquo;: I follow Apple\u0026rsquo;s keynotes, and they always talk about how there are \u0026ldquo;great new ways\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;share and connect\u0026rdquo; with your friends. While sharing digital photos is a new phenomenon, this idea of connecting—not electronically, but in the human sense—requires no new technology. It\u0026rsquo;s easy to get caught up in the frenzy of \u0026ldquo;the latest new thing\u0026rdquo;, but once you wipe away the chrome, there\u0026rsquo;s surprisingly little substance underneath.\nFacebook touts \u0026ldquo;community\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;connecting people\u0026rdquo; as intrinsically valuable things. But are they? Not too long ago I read this in Ars Technica:\nAccusing Facebook\u0026rsquo;s algorithm of \u0026ldquo;promoting hatred and anger,\u0026rdquo; Himes added, \u0026ldquo;You keep using the word \u0026lsquo;community\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;authentic.\u0026rsquo; Those are value-neutral words. There is nothing good or bad about authenticity or good or bad about community.\u0026rdquo; Indeed, he went on, \u0026ldquo;community\u0026rdquo; can be explicitly bad.\nTechnopoly points out the general phenomenon going on here: technology (and technology-centric companies\u0026rsquo; marketing departments!) push us to value things that technology can accomplish: we value machines and processes that are \u0026ldquo;faster\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;more efficient\u0026rdquo;, but we ask whether or not these new technologies add meaningful value far too infrequently.\nI will add here that, amidst a pandemic, platforms like Facebook do truly add some value because we cannot meet together safely as we usually would. If anything, the way this pandemic has forced us to rely on digital facsimiles of in-person interaction should help us value the intrinsically and irreplaceable human qualities of what society, connection, and friendship really are.\nNot everything that counts can be counted… # Statistics is another tool that Postman discusses in his book. I won\u0026rsquo;t go too into depth here, but continuing on with the Facebook example, consider the case of \u0026ldquo;friends\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;likes\u0026rdquo;: these numbers serve as measures for how popular one is or how engaging someone\u0026rsquo;s blurb/photo/whatever is. Do these numbers measure anything of value? I think it\u0026rsquo;s hard to argue that they do. They are simplified, watered-down metrics that are easy to measure and compare. Because it\u0026rsquo;s easy to measure and compare these numbers, we\u0026rsquo;ve attached some value to them.\nI guess if you\u0026rsquo;re an advertiser,1 those metrics can give you some idea of whether or not your ad campaign is working. But Facebook doesn\u0026rsquo;t advertise (har har) itself to ordinary users as an ad platform. It says that it\u0026rsquo;s a social network, and then gamifies acquiring \u0026ldquo;friends\u0026rdquo; and making \u0026ldquo;connections\u0026rdquo;. But in real relationships, quality trumps quantity. People with a few good friends are happier than those with only a thousand acquaintances. But because of the presence and ease of use of these metrics, we have imputed value to them.\nTools: do we use them, or are we used by them? # Facebook isn\u0026rsquo;t the only technology to emerge in recent years that represents a fundamental value shift. There are others too. Consider Twitter: so much dialog happens on Twitter, and the tacit philosophy behind Twitter seems to be that you can have meaningful discussions when limited to 280 characters.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s not inevitable that we think that way, but the technology of tweets tends to direct our dialog in that way.\nTwitter is not the only technology that\u0026rsquo;s had a degrading effect on our public discourse: Postman makes a compelling argument in Amusing Ourselves to Death that television—and if he had lived to see it, he would have argued that the Internet as it is today—has had an insidious effect on our dialog.\nPostman is somewhat pessimistic about our prognosis. I\u0026rsquo;m a little more hopeful that individuals will be able to master technology rather than letting it master them. I agree, however, that it is difficult; to this end, Postman offers a few points of advice:\nThose who resist the American Technopoly are people\n…who refuse to accept efficiency as the pre-eminent goal of human relations;\n…who are, at least, suspicious of the idea of progress, and who do not confuse information with understanding;\nwho do not regard the aged as irrelevant;…\npp. 183–184\nThere\u0026rsquo;s a lot more in there that I can\u0026rsquo;t put down here. Go read the book yourself.\nConclusions # Reading this book has made me think about how I use and interact with technology. I abandoned Facebook over two years ago,2 so no changes on that front.\nI try and read from the Bible or the Book of Mormon every morning, and I like taking notes about what I read. I used to take notes with a pen and a notebook, but I switched to digital notes about two years ago. Recently I noticed that I started spending a lot of time working on maintaining all my cross references and indexes, rather than devoting that time to actual study. I decided to be a little more conscientious about how I use my time: I\u0026rsquo;ve since limited interaction with my computer to reviewing the study plan that I\u0026rsquo;ve set for myself. Once I\u0026rsquo;ve gone over my plan, I sit down a short distance away from my laptop and just read a hard copy of the scriptures.\nWhy did I start using digital notes in the first place? I wanted all my notes to be indexable and searchable. That has been nice, but Technopoly got me thinking about why I actually study: I seek for a connection with God each morning. If my note taking system is getting in the way of that, then I am doing something wrong.\nThis kind of examination is what Postman suggests as our primary defense against the encroachment of technology: we should examine every new technology, find what we give up by adopting it, and decide whether or not it is worth the price.\nWhich, to be fair, is the whole purpose of Facebook: put more ads in front of people\u0026rsquo;s faces.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nThough, at the time of that post, I hadn\u0026rsquo;t yet deleted my account.

A question I asked myself was: why do we work on, refine, and create new programming languages?\nI thought of several reasons, but they seemed to boil down into two broader reasons:\nBetter abstractions and more automation: some languages automate and ease some tedious tasks like memory management, concurrency, or type annotations. Almost all languages give you some ways of creating abstractions that let you reason with concepts in your problem domain, but different languages do this in different ways.\nMore precisely describe what you want: languages like Haskell let you describe the behavior of your program very precisely with an expressive type system. This lets you write correct programs with a high degree of confidence.\nOther languages give you a different level of control: C lets you manipulate bits at arbitrary memory locations and evaluate them as you please. You can get very good performance from a well-tuned C program.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s some overlap between these domains for sure, but these goals often seem to conflict one another: the first objective seems optimal for drafting programs. The second group is more tuned for long-running projects or programs with specific constraints. Permissive languages like Perl, Ruby, and most Lisps seem designed with the first objective in mind and are very easy to use when exploring an idea. They can be expressive and concise. More demanding languages, like Rust or Haskell, seem optimized for a long-lived project or a program with intensive system resource constraints or performance requirements. Maybe some people can draft in Rust, but I find it more difficult to whip up something in Rust than Perl or Elixir.\nCan we reconcile these two goals? Maybe. I think the further away you get away from the machine—trading some fine-grained control for abstraction—the closer the goals can converge. You can have a language well-suited for discovering an idea, which can then let you evolve your program into a more correct, reliable version.\nIn the end, I don\u0026rsquo;t think there is a perfect language. But some languages are more perfect than others! Hopefully I\u0026rsquo;ll strike on something interesting in my fumbling about with PL.\n"},{"id":39,"href":"/posts/2020-07-22-gui-emacs/","title":"Transitioning to GUI'd Emacs on macOS","section":"Technical Blog","content":"I went on an adventure today. I left behind the stable comforts of the terminal and compiled bleeding-edge Emacs that uses a native window system.\nThis is a big deal for me. As long as I can remember, I\u0026rsquo;ve used Emacs from within a terminal. I\u0026rsquo;ve decided to give the GUI\u0026rsquo;d Emacs a whirl.\nMy Journey # I\u0026rsquo;m running macOS Catalina (10.15.5). Originally I tried using the pre-built packages via brew (brew cask install emacs) and those available at Emacs for Mac OS X. However, all these pre-built binaries crashed on Catalina. I guess it\u0026rsquo;s a problem with Catalina. 🙄\nSo, I decided to try building from source. I cloned the Emacs source code directly from Savannah:\n$ git clone https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/emacs.git I cd\u0026rsquo;d into that directory:\n$ cd emacs At this point you\u0026rsquo;ve got the bleeding-edge development Emacs. You might want to check out and pull a different branch or tag. I decided to check out the native-compilation branch:\n$ git checkout feature/native-comp $ git pull origin feature/native-comp (I\u0026rsquo;m pretty sure those are the right commands; stuff got a little funky while I was building.)\nI exported a magic1 environment variable that I got from a helpful Emacs StackExchange post:\n$ export LIBXML2_CFLAGS=\u0026quot;-I/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk/usr/include/libxml2\u0026quot; After exporting that variable, I ran configure:\n$ ./configure Then I ran make:\n$ make That will create a binary at src/emacs that you can run to test to make sure that all is working as it should. If you\u0026rsquo;re satisfied with that emacs configuration, you can bundle it up into a stand-alone application:\n$ make install This will create Emacs.app inside of the nextstep/ directory. You are free to move that around:\n$ mv nextstep/Emacs.app /Applications/ I also went into System Preferences \u0026gt; Security and gave Emacs Full Disk Access. I heard of some people having difficulty accessing iCloud files from Emacs and this cleared it up. I haven\u0026rsquo;t had any difficulty—I just wanted Emacs to have full access anyway.\nNiceties # I still use the terminal a lot (though I might use it less directly if I can get comfortable with ansi-term mode) so I made a few shortcuts for myself:\nI symlinked /usr/local/bin/emacs to /Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/Emacs:\n$ cd /usr/local/bin $ ln -s /Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/Emacs emacs /usr/local/bin is already in my PATH, so now I can just type emacs on the command line and it will fire it up just as it used to\nI created an alias like this in my .zshrc file:\nalias 'e'='emacs -nw' That way, when I\u0026rsquo;m in a terminal and type e \u0026lt;filename\u0026gt; it will open up the file in Emacs in the terminal. I might change that behavior at some point in the future, but that will help me transition for the time being.\nI installed the exec-path-from-shell package so that Emacs could fire off processes like elixir when using lsp-mode. Otherwise, you get errors like this inside the *lsp::stderr* buffer:\nline 66: exec: elixir: not found Conclusion # Why did I do this? Because I was a little bored. I also wanted to experiment with some of the more extensive key binding opportunities that a full-bodied Emacs offers.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll write updates to my blog as time goes on. I might decide to switch back to regular-old Emacs in the terminal. Right now, however, I\u0026rsquo;m enjoying the GUI\u0026rsquo;d version.\nYou can see my Emacs config on my GitHub. Feel free to drop me a line if you have any questions.\nUPDATE 2020-07-23 # After using Emacs 28.0.5 for a day, here\u0026rsquo;s what I came away with:\nNo crashes. Things did start getting a little strange when I tried selecting text with the mouse in ansi-term without switching from character-mode to line-mode; I ended up killing that ansi-term session and creating a new one.\nI really missed having frames all in the same place and switching between them with C-x 5 o. I found a very acceptable replacement; as of Emacs 27, you can enable the built-in tab-bar-mode and switch between \u0026ldquo;tabs\u0026rdquo; with C-x t o, create new ones with C-x t 2, etc. It looks just like switching between frames does in the terminal, minus the display of which tab you\u0026rsquo;re on. I haven\u0026rsquo;t figured out how to turn that on yet.\nUsing the tab-bar stuff, I created a tab and fired up ansi-term. I was able to switch back and forth between my editor tab and the console tab as I would between iTerm tabs or if I were using C-z to suspend.\nInputting special characters via the keyboard has changed. No longer can I hit alt-shift-- to insert an em-dash. Instead, I turn on TeX mode input (C-\\ TeX RET) and I can type the TeX character sequence (in the case of an em-dash, you just type a normal dash three times) and it will be inserted into the buffer.\nIn short, I\u0026rsquo;m finding this switch a decently comfortable one. I\u0026rsquo;m not giving up very much, and I\u0026rsquo;m gaining a decent amount. I\u0026rsquo;ve had some difficulty getting all the colors in the theme how I like them—I might just give up for a bit and see if I get used to them.\nI\u0026rsquo;m not entirely sure what it does. I know that it didn\u0026rsquo;t work before using this environment variable, and now it works after I tried using it.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n"},{"id":40,"href":"/posts/2020-06-15-languages-and-fonts/","title":"Programming Languages and Typography","section":"Technical Blog","content":"An analogy occurred to me this evening as I was thinking about programming language design:\nChoosing good keywords and function names is like picking a good font; the ideas conveyed may be the same, but a change can drastically impact legibility and enjoyment of use.\nPHP does a spectacular job of providing a bad example. It\u0026rsquo;s like the Comic Sans of programming languages. Now there are many reasons why PHP is not a good language—I\u0026rsquo;d like to investigate this particular aspect of its design here briefly.\nThere are ~55 functions in PHP that start with array_. Why? Why would you need to call the map operator array_map?

Our news, politics, education, and even religion are delivered to us primarily through television, where they were once delivered via the written word. This transformation of medium is not irrelevant: just as poetry doesn\u0026rsquo;t survive fully intact when translated from one language to another, likewise ideas do not survive translation of medium.\nThis book was written in 1986. What foresight. If Postman was worried about the effects that television was having on public discourse, he would have been scared silly to see how much of our dialog is held online on Facebook and Twitter, where all ideas are compressed into 140 to 280 characters and algorithms designed to optimize for consumer engagement determine what rises to prominence and what does not. Thus rational thought is drowned out\u0026mdash;stamped out\u0026mdash;by a deluge of content that is shallow, simplistic, and sensational.\nWhat follows are my notes that I wrote as I read the book, organized by chapter. Do note that these notes are not meant to stand on their own; if you have not read the book, they will likely seem disjoint.\nReading Notes # Typographic America (p. 30) # The typographical America read a lot.\nThe telegraph commoditized information: news was suddenly taken out of context and held as valuable per se. The question: if something is not relevant to my actions, can it still be valuable?\nThe Peek-a-Boo World (p.64) # p. 69: Is the problem then in unidirectional means of communication? We can\u0026rsquo;t reply and can\u0026rsquo;t really engage. We become passive and the signal gets lost in the noise.\nNow\u0026hellip; This (p. 99) # The idea here seems to be this: television has become the paradigm of information transmittal. Because it strips things of context and things are to be understood by themselves, contradictions fade. Magazines follow suit: entertainment is news, and news must be entertaining.\nShuffle Off to Bethlehem (p. 114) # p. 117: Prose survives translation between languages, whereas poetry does not survive. Likewise, ideas do not survive changes in medium unchanged. Television (and now mediums like Twitter, Instagram, etc.) do great violence to ideas.\np. 121: TV demands that what what be presented be easy. Elder Maxwell\u0026rsquo;s talks are nice to watch, but move far too quickly and are way more intricate than can be comfortably comprehended. There is some place for easy: beginners to faith will have difficulty appreciating everything about Elder Maxwell.\nReach Out and Elect Someone (p. 125) # p. 128: Commercials are less about the character of the product and mare more about the character of the consumer.\nReach out and Elect Someone (p. 126) # Capitalism works when the buyer and producer can both know what is good and what is valuable. In sports, there are rules and standards that cannot be muffled over; a basketball player who misses all his free throws cannot weasel his way into being considered a \u0026ldquo;good player\u0026rdquo;.\nYet the virtues exposed by television are how entertaining something is. It becomes \u0026ldquo;How good can a president look?\u0026rdquo; rather than \u0026ldquo;is this a good man?\u0026rdquo; We see that quite strongly today.\np. 135:\nAs Xenophanes remarked twenty-five centuries ago, men always make their gods in their own image. But to this, television politics has added a new wrinkle: Those who would be gods refashion themselves into images the viewers would have them be.\nIs this what gets Trump supporters so fanatic\u0026mdash;to the point where they cannot see his contradictions? What image does he portray that they wish they had?\nOne thing he projects is a disregard for the status quo. He\u0026rsquo;s also fiercely tribal\u0026mdash;people want an enemy they can scapegoat, and he leads the charge against everyone and everything. People then feel like if they\u0026rsquo;re on his team, they\u0026rsquo;re winning. What they think they\u0026rsquo;re winning, I have no idea. But they seem to think that they are winning something.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s kind of like a game show: a meaningless contest of luck, strength, trivia recall, etc. which is filmed in a futuristic studio. Everything is automatic and accompanied by jazzy music and flashing lights. Game shows are strange things.\np. 141: Television\u0026rsquo;s Censorship: television doesn\u0026rsquo;t ban books\u0026mdash;it displaces them, which is just as bad. I\u0026rsquo;ve wished for a super power\u0026mdash;not to be invisible, but that no one would be able to focus their attention on me and pay attention to what I am doing. It would be far easier to get away with stuff if no one noticed you than it would be if you were merely invisible: floating objects catch people\u0026rsquo;s attention rather quickly!\np. 141: Collateral learning: what do you learn outside of the content of the lesson?

Here\u0026rsquo;s my 2¢.\nSummary # I think everyone should wear a mask, unless they have a compelling medical reason not to.\nLook at it this way: a mask will either help you and those around you, or it will do no harm—beyond a little social awkwardness. If we look at the trade-offs in a game-theory-style matrix, we get:\n| | Masks Help | Masks don\u0026rsquo;t help | |\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;-+\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;+\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;| | Wear a mask | +100 | 0 | | Don\u0026rsquo;t wear a mask | -100 | 0 |\nThere is nothing to loose by wearing a mask, while there is the possibility of loosing a whole lot if we don\u0026rsquo;t. There\u0026rsquo;s some preliminary research showing that masks in fact help prevent transmission of COVID-19.\nOne way to think about wearing a mask is it\u0026rsquo;s like wearing a seat belt: seat belts save lives. Wearing seat belts is mandatory—rightly so!\nBut masks, unlike seat belts, not only help the wearer, but also protect others. True, cloth masks (home-made; surgical masks and N95 masks do much better of course) don\u0026rsquo;t seem to provide much protection for the wearers, but they do catch some non-negligible portion of the virus coming out of infected people. That one glob of saliva, if it lands right, could be the difference between life-and-death for someone else.\nWearing a mask shows respect and care for those around you. It shows solidarity: hundreds of thousands of people have died across the world—with over 100,000 in the US alone. We need to look out for each other.\nRefusing to wear a mask is disrespectful. It\u0026rsquo;s more than just driving without a seat belt. It\u0026rsquo;s like driving drunk: you might be fine, but there are so many other people that you are endangering.\nIf you continue to not wear a mask just because you feel it restricts your freedom, then I think society is well within its rights to deny you access or services out of self-preservation: the ice cream licker faces prison time, and drunk drivers can have their licenses suspended.\nFinally, think about the disrespect and selfishness you show by not wearing a mask. In essence you are saying, \u0026ldquo;I cannot be bothered to put up with mild discomfort in order to potentially save people\u0026rsquo;s lives.\u0026rdquo;\nIf you think I\u0026rsquo;m wrong about something or that there\u0026rsquo;s something I ought to understand better, please reach out to me via my Keybase. (My email is also in my résumé if Keybase isn\u0026rsquo;t working for you.)

At the lowest level they\u0026rsquo;re just a pile of ones and zeros that we assign meaning to. It\u0026rsquo;s something you can easily take for granted, but there\u0026rsquo;s a disconnect with how we talk about how things operate at the hardware level and then again at the software level.\nSince writing a compiler, I\u0026rsquo;ve been able to bridge that gap in part. The fundamental idea is that we represent some meaning in a concrete, though still high-level form. Example: we might represent an entry in a contact book with a struct.\ndefstruct [name: :string, age: :integer] The critical step is this: we find a way to consistently represent that entity in the physical realm. We pack up a bunch of ones and zeros next to each other that are spaced apart at the right distances. Operations on bits in that neighborhood have to obey the rules we put in place. (E.g. treat the bits representing the age as a single thing, the bits representing the name can be broken up along character boundaries, etc.) Once our operations are complete, assuming our rules—our invariants—were never violated, then we can ascribe new meaning to the resulting mass of ones and zeros.\nPerhaps this isn\u0026rsquo;t that profound.

Once thing that I love about helm is how discoverable it makes commands and functions. helm also got me into using bookmarks. I don\u0026rsquo;t keep many bookmarks; I tend to collect a few when working on a multi-file project long-term. The bookmark that I use most consistently is to my .emacs file; these days I\u0026rsquo;m fiddling constantly with my settings.\nI switched to Ivy because I found its completion options to be killer when using Magit: being able to fuzzy match branch names was sooo nice. I\u0026rsquo;ve also liked how Ivy handled completing file names. I feel faster. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if I\u0026rsquo;m that much faster navigating around my file tree with it, but it does feel nice. There\u0026rsquo;s so much that Ivy makes better: any function using completing-read benefits from Ivy\u0026rsquo;s fuzzy matching.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s been a gradual process; there\u0026rsquo;s a lot that Helm does out-of-the-box that Ivy took some tweaking to get right. For example, sorting candidates for M-x by most recently used was one of my favorite features of Helm. I had to install Ivy Prescient to get the behavior I wanted. On top of that, I needed Counsel to show the key bindings next to their functions in M-x. Finally, I like to be able to fuzzy match anywhere within the command name, so I took out the leading ^ in counsel with this:\n(use-package counsel :config (ivy-configure \u0026#39;counsel-M-x :initial-input \u0026#34;\u0026#34;)) Conclusion # Both Helm and Ivy are fantastic packages. They\u0026rsquo;ve changed the way I use Emacs and I feel like they\u0026rsquo;ve made me substantially more productive and happy. If you haven\u0026rsquo;t used either, you might want to start off with Helm for a nice out-of-the-box experience with loads of features and sensible defaults. However, if you just would like to be able to fuzzy-match things, Ivy is your library. It\u0026rsquo;s fast, clean, and configurable.

We devote a lot of time and effort into managing that chaos. I thought of a little \u0026ldquo;theory\u0026rdquo;, if you will, that helps me.\nThe Home Theory # Everything needs a home. The class of things that need homes is broad. It includes:\nSchool assignments Legal documents Pictures Recipies Ideas Projects Books Charging cables Tools etc. The home needs to suit the thing that goes there. I have found that getting this right is really tricky. But once you have a home for a thing, you never loose it. You will want to put things back into their homes when you are done using it, because it will feel right. If the home doesn\u0026rsquo;t fit the item, you run into a bit of friction—that slows you down and makes you more likely to put the thing where it\u0026rsquo;s easy.\nOne thing that stood out to me from Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance was the author\u0026rsquo;s discussion about tools. Regarding tool organization:\nOne of the first warning signs of impatience is frusttration at not being able to lay your hand on the tool you need right away. If you just stop and put tools away neatly you will both find the tool and also scale down your impatience wihout wasing time or endangering the work. (pp. 286)\nI mentioned this a bit when I talked about text editors, but this holds true for more things than physical or software tools. Consider a home for finances: if you have a budgeting program you always use, then it\u0026rsquo;s much easier to keep track of your finances because records of transactions have a home to go to.\nThe investment of time is worth it.\nSymptoms of No Home # I once didn\u0026rsquo;t have a home for a while. I mean, I lived in a house and was provided with more than adequate food, shelter, clothing, etc. However, I didn\u0026rsquo;t have a room. We were rennovating our basement to make more space, and until that was complete, I slept on an air mattress.\nThe air mattress was no problem. I was young enough that it didn\u0026rsquo;t hurt my back. (I can\u0026rsquo;t believe that I\u0026rsquo;m suddenly \u0026ldquo;old\u0026rdquo; and reposing on a mattress hurts my back!) The biggest struggle for me is that I didn\u0026rsquo;t have a home for my stuff, and I didn\u0026rsquo;t have a place where I could go to be quiet.\nI\u0026rsquo;m quite introverted. That means after spending time with people, I need quiet time to relax and recharge. I didn\u0026rsquo;t get that. The barrage of noise I experience in that time made it difficult for me at times.\nI\u0026rsquo;m grateful that I have a home now. It\u0026rsquo;s important.

As with all professions, using the right tools makes a huge difference in my productivity and general happiness. Having good tools helps me keep my gumption up.\nOne of my favorite books is Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance. Contrary to what the title suggests, this book is actually not about motorcycles. It’s about a lot of things; one topic is about tools and caring about your trade.\n… By far the most frustrating gumption trap is inadequate tools. Nothing’s quite so demoralizing as a tool hang-up. Buy good tools as you can afford them and you’ll never regret it.‌‌(ibid. p.g. 291)\nFor me, my most important tool is my text editor: manipulating source code is what I spend ALL DAY doing. I’ve selected Emacs as my primary text editor.\nLots of programmers use what’s called an IDE If programming were cooking, then an IDE would be a knife that has a sink, a strainer, and a toaster-oven built into it.\nI find IDE’s visually distracting. Everything is done with buttons that you click. Emacs has so much more screen devoted to content.\nEmacs and Vim do have steeper learning curves. This is in part because the absence buttons make the features only discoverable via manuals. When working with an IDE, the presense of buttons hints at the existence of certain features.\nI find it a shame when people don\u0026rsquo;t read, prefering a video tutorial or the like. Emacs’s features are very discoverable, but not in the way most people are used to. The apropos-function command is terribly useful—if you think a certain command should exist, searching all available function names for a particular string has helped me find both what I\u0026rsquo;ve gone looking for, and what I didn\u0026rsquo;t know I wanted!\nThe advantage to using keyboard only navigation is that hundreds of commands are immediately available all the time, without having to dig through menus or such. It takes me the same amount of time to access complicated commands as it does moving around a file.\nAgain, from Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance:\n…One of the first warning signs of impatience is frustration at not being able to lay your hand on the tool you need right away.‌‌(ibid. p.g. 286)\nMoving a mouse takes me out of my flow, which slows me down and leads to gumption traps. If something takes longer, I\u0026rsquo;m more reluctant to do it. That means my productivity drops.\nNow, you might have used a word processor for text editing all your life. Or perhaps you\u0026rsquo;re comfortable with your IDE. I encourage you to stretch beyond what you\u0026rsquo;re comfortable with, and learn Emacs. An investment in a powerful text editor will change how you consider how you program. Editing will become more fluid, and the barrier of buttons and menus will fade away.\nLearning Emacs # There is an index of learning resources here. If you\u0026rsquo;re just looking for a cheat sheet, check this link out. Also, see my cheat sheet. (I update this one occasionally.)\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re coming from an IDE and miss feature X, you might be able to find the corresponding Emacs feature here.\nPicture Credit # I found this via a Google Image search; the origional file came from this blog post, which I think resonates with mine quite well.\n"},{"id":56,"href":"/posts/personal/2018-11-20-the-best-two-years/","title":"The Best Two Years","section":"Personal Blog","content":"September 30th marked two years since I arrived home from serving a two-year mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The mission is colloquially referred to as \u0026ldquo;the best two years\u0026rdquo;. (There is a movie about missionaries, which I have not seen, by this title.)\nMy time on the mission did constitute the best two years of my life. I grew and learned so much in that time. Not only did I get to visit some incredible historical places (I visited the Berlin Wall, a concentration camp, and Karl Friedrich Gauss\u0026rsquo;s grave, just to name a few) but I got to get to know people from all over the world.\nI also thought about the meaning of life and the nature of joy every day. Focusing on helping other people be happy has a profound effect on one\u0026rsquo;s own happiness—I forgot myself, my worries, and my cares, and found joy in helping others learn more about Jesus Christ.\nThe past two years # When I left on my mission, my dad wrote the following to me:\nThese will be the best two years of your life until this point. When you return home, continue to serve the Lord, and those will be the best to years of your life after that.\nThis has been true for me. Since returning home, I\u0026rsquo;ve been able to start school, serve in multiple callings, be a home teacher, visit China, find some long-lost family members in Germany, help friends through some bouts of depression, and marry a most wonderful woman.\nLife has been awesome. Sure, there have been hard times. My life is far from perfect. I\u0026rsquo;ve gotten ill, been stressed, felt sorrow at the pain my friends and family went through at times. I\u0026rsquo;ve grown from these things, however. I\u0026rsquo;ve found meaning in continuing to serve God in my \u0026ldquo;normal\u0026rdquo; life. It\u0026rsquo;s been wonderful.\nGod is good. He loves us, and wants the best for us. It might not always seem like it, but if we see hard times and growing pains, He will take us to places we never dreamt were possible.\nDie Beste zwei Jahren # Am 30. September ist es zwei Jahren gewesen, seitdem ich von ein zwei jährige ehrenamtlich Mission für die Kirche Jesu Christi der Heiligen der letzten Tagen heimgekehrt bin. Die Mission wird umgangssprachlich als \u0026ldquo;die beste zwei Jahren\u0026rdquo; genannt. (Es gibt sogar einen Film, den ich nicht angeschaut habe, der so genannt ist.)\nMeine Mission war die beste zwei Jahren meines Lebens. Ich habe viel gelernt.

Ich habe mich selbst vergessen und andern geholfen von Christus zu erfahren, und dadurch habe ich Freude gefunden.\nDie letzte zwei Jahren # Als ich bereit war nach Deutschland zu fliegen, hat mein Vater mir folgendes geschrieben:\nDie nächste zwei Jahren werden die besten so weit sein. Nachdem du nach Hause kommst, diene den Herr weiter und du wirst immer weiter die \u0026ldquo;beste zwei Jahren\u0026rdquo; erfahren.\nDas stimmt. Seitdem ich zurückgekehrt bin, habe ich mit der Schule angefangen, viel Dienst in und aus der Kirche geleistet, China besucht, Familienmitglieder aus Deutschland gefunden und eine wunderbare Frau heiraten.\nDas Leben ist ausgezeichnet.

Ich bin dankbar, dass ich Gott noch als ein \u0026ldquo;normaler\u0026rdquo; Mensch dienen darf. Es ist einfach wunderbar.\nGott ist gut. Er liebt uns und er will, dass wir Freude finden.

Namely, when you climb up a step, you get tired. Eventually, there comes a point where you get so tired that you collapse from exhaustion, fall off the ladder and smack into the hard, uncaring ground of reality below.\nThis will happen to you too if your recursive functions have side effects: you code will be really hard to debug, and eventually, a bug somewhere in the state of your system will deftly shove your process off the call stack to crash on the cold, hard, uncaring silicon below.\nPhoto by Robin Joshua on Unsplash\n"},{"id":58,"href":"/posts/2018-08-11-life-hacks-text-notifications/","title":"Life Hacks: Text Notifications","section":"Technical Blog","content":" Life Hacks: Text Notifications # So many notifications come to us in the form of an audible alert, and this can sometimes be inconvenient. Who likes having their phone go off in church? The problem is that sound propagates regardless of the intended target. Touch, on the other hand, is an inherently personal sensation. Setting your phone to vibrate lets you know you\u0026rsquo;re being alerted, without notifying everyone else in the room as well.\nUnless you read Braille, touch has far less bandwidth than sound. However, you can pack a small amount of information into a vibration, like who\u0026rsquo;s calling or texting you.

I\u0026rsquo;m not going to delete my account, but I\u0026rsquo;m no longer checking Facebook more than once or twice a month, if that. I\u0026rsquo;m not trying to be a recluse—below are a few ways to contact me that I do check far more often than Facebook. I want to be your friend, but I\u0026rsquo;d rather that friendship be through a real connection rather than some online \u0026ldquo;status\u0026rdquo;.\nWhy I\u0026rsquo;m Leaving # First of all, I care deeply about my online privacy. I\u0026rsquo;m not perfect, but I try to keep myself free from trackers so I can decide what I see online instead of aggregators like Facebook and Google. Facebook is out to get you and your contact information. I don\u0026rsquo;t like it.\nSecondly, I don\u0026rsquo;t like Facebook\u0026rsquo;s closed model of the Internet—they make it so search engines can\u0026rsquo;t find even public Facebook posts. Their model not what I want for anything I choose to share with the world—this blog is much better. Additionally, with my blog, I have a much richer medium for publishing my thoughts and writing.\nFinally, I don\u0026rsquo;t think Facebook merits a daily scroll-through. The information that I care about I find in other news sources and online in manuals. For entertainment, I usually read books or play a game on my phone. Reading about the minutia of people\u0026rsquo;s lives is not interesting to me.\nThat being said…\nI\u0026rsquo;m still keeping my account # Why? Because all you guys use it, and I want to know when you get married, have a baby, when there\u0026rsquo;s a mission reunion, etc. I would really prefer to learn about these things via some other medium, but until we all migrate to Keybase or something, I\u0026rsquo;m going to keep one eye on what my friends like to publish on Facebook. Even then, I\u0026rsquo;ll still likely miss many things. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯\nI\u0026rsquo;ll also link to my blog posts. There\u0026rsquo;s stuff I\u0026rsquo;d like to share with you guys, and this is the way I\u0026rsquo;d like to do it. It gives me a richer medium to communicate. Furthermore, writing a blog post is more arduous than writing something on Facebook—if I write something, it means I will have found it sufficiently important to spend some time on.\nHow to contact me # A few options to contact me:\nEmail—my first name dot then my last name at mailblock dot net.1 That\u0026rsquo;s probably the easiest. Keybase—it\u0026rsquo;s a free messaging/file sharing app. My Keybase ID is ashton314. I prefer this method: it\u0026rsquo;s secure and private. GitHub—really only if it\u0026rsquo;s about code. Friends—find someone who has my number and ask them for it. Please don\u0026rsquo;t send it over Facebook Messenger, though.

Mir ist es wichtiger andere Sachen zu lesen, statt dass, was Facebook mir gibt.\nJedoch…\nIch lösche mein Konto nicht. # Der Grund dafür ist einfach: ihr seid alle noch auf Facebook. Ich freue mich wann ich von ihre schöne Lebenserfahrungen höre. Ich möchte es wissen, wann ihr heiraten, ein Baby bekommen, wenn es ein Missionstreffen gibt, usw. Ich höre es liber durch ein anderes Mittel als Facebook, aber bis wir alle auf Keybase sind, werde ich noch ein Facebook Konto behalten. Ich werde aber viele Dinge verpassen. Bitte wissen, dass es nicht persönlich gemeint ist: wir sind noch Freunden, ich gehe einfach ganz ganz selten auf Facebook.\nWie man mich kontaktieren kann # Es gibt einige Möglichkeiten:\nEmail—mein erster Name Punkt mein letzter Name at mailblock Punkt net.2 Das ist wahrscheinlich am einfachsten.

Below are some stories from our courtship.\nFirst time seeing each other # It was the first day of trek. I found my family and sat down at the most extreme end of the bench. I got to know my trek brothers a little bit, but mostly kept to myself. I think I remember making eye contact with Sarah for the first time: she was sitting in the row in front of me. I introduced myself. I was actually fighting a cold—my throat was very sore and my voice was lower than usual. Beyond the pain in my throat, however, I was feeling alright.\nAt some point Sarah must have moved to the other side of the pew where our family was. Some lady from the stake got up to the pulpit and gave us some advice and encouragement about getting to know our families. She suggested that we stay in contact with our trek siblings after everything was done.\n\u0026ldquo;You never know,\u0026rdquo; she said. \u0026ldquo;Some people have even gotten married!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Ha,\u0026rdquo; I thought. \u0026ldquo;I would be the last person that would happen to. I don\u0026rsquo;t think that\u0026rsquo;s even a possibility for me. Is there anyone in my family that\u0026rsquo;s old enough to date?\u0026rdquo;\nI looked down the row and Sarah and I made eye contact. She waved.\n\u0026ldquo;She\u0026rsquo;s pretty cute,\u0026rdquo; I admitted. \u0026ldquo;Maybe I could ask her out on a date.\u0026rdquo;\nLittle did I know.\nTrek # I had managed to grow a wispy beard the summer between my junior and senior years. I\u0026rsquo;m not proud of it now, but I was pretty satisfied with it then. I never did anything with my hair. It was straight and long. On trek, it got greasy and looked… well… unusual after wearing a hat in the sun for several hours.\nThis is how I met my wife. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯\nHaving done swim team, I was the most athletic person in our entire family. Needless to say, we were lacking somewhat in physical strength. I spent most of my time at the front of the handcart pulling. The girls pushed from behind, and the other boys switched between pulling at the T-bar with me and pulling on a rope we had tied to the hand cart from the front.\nOne time I took a break from the front of the hand cart and moved to the back to push. Sarah was there, and we got talking. I asked her about school—I learned that she had taken AP music theory and AP calculus the previous school year, as had I. I was intrigued: I had prided myself on the fact that I studied a variety of subjects. And now here was a girl who had studied the exact same things that I did. I resolved at that point to get this girl\u0026rsquo;s contact information and get to know her better after trek was through.\nThat was the best decision I made that trip.\nFirst date # There is nothing like a phone call to ask someone out on a date. I had carefully planned a double date with my cousin Alex. We were going to go to the dinosaur museum at Thanksgiving Point and then JCW\u0026rsquo;s for dessert afterwards. All that I had left to do was call and ask Sarah.\nI looked up the Cowley\u0026rsquo;s number in the stake directory. I dialed. The phone rang for what seemed like an eternity. It was probably just my nerves. Finally, Sarah answered.\nI identified myself and made sure I was speaking with Sarah. I was. I wanted to ask Sarah if she had seen Despicable Me 2—there is a part where Gru wants to ask Lucy out on a date, but he\u0026rsquo;s really nervous, and ends up burning the telephone with a flamethrower. I tried to tell her about this, but I slaughtered the explanation. I ended up confusing her, and I was embarrassed at the terribly bungled attempt at telling a joke.\nShe said yes, though! The date went super smoothly. We said we\u0026rsquo;d be home by 9pm. However, at JCW\u0026rsquo;s, we got talking and asked for an hour extension… twice! We got home by 11pm. Easily my best date up until that point.\nFirst \u0026ldquo;date\u0026rdquo; post-mission # I got home from my mission conference weekend. I enjoyed the time watching conference with my family.\nMonday at 5pm I got on Facebook and sent Sarah a message. I was really eager to see her again, and I was searching desperately for a way to meet her in some way that was not an out-right date. Brooke had institute Tuesday morning, so I invited Sarah to come with me and her to that.\nTuesday morning I got out of the car, walked up the steps, and paused in front of the door. I was nervous—excited and overjoyed—but nervous to see her again after two long years. I knocked.\nAn agonizing two seconds later, she opened the door, and I got to see those beautiful blue eyes again. I wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure how to greet her—I just kind of gestured towards the car and away we went. We didn\u0026rsquo;t hug or anything, but we did sit next to each other in the back seat of the car.\nThe next day I asked her if she would like to meet to tell each other more about our missions. I didn\u0026rsquo;t think much of it—I thought it was something like a member appointment. I picked her up from her house that evening and we went to get frozen yogurt. As it became time to pay, I realized that I had basically asked her out on a date—my first one-on-one date, at that. Having realized this, I then paid for the treat.\nConclusion # There are many more stories. I don\u0026rsquo;t know if I\u0026rsquo;ll get around to telling them all. I hope you enjoyed the ones I did manage to tell!\nTrek is a reenactment of the Mormon Pioneer handcart migration across North America.

This quote bothered me because I felt that it maligned religion. I asked this friend for some clarification; it seemed clear from their response that they had had a rather negative experience with religion. They explained that they felt that religion (in general) micro-manages the lives of its adherents and focuses on telling people what they can\u0026rsquo;t do.\nWell, I don\u0026rsquo;t pretend to know everything about what my friend has experienced. To be sure, there is no perfectly lived religion on earth. I can understand to some degree where negative sentiments about religion come from. However, I am happy to report that my experience with religion has been a profoundly positive one.\nI came across the following in the Book of Mormon:\nAnd whatsoever thing persuadeth men to do good is of me; for good cometh of none save it be of me. I am the same that leadeth men to all good…\n( Ether 4:12)\nMy religion is very much not about what one can and cannot do. Rather, my religion is about living to maximize joy. All those things that we are told not to do are things that, in the long run, will bring sadness.\n(I would like to note that by joy, I mean something distinct from pleasure. Pleasure is a transient, ephemeral sensation, whereas joy is a deep, pure, lasting happiness.)\nI try to focus on what I can do to bring more happiness to myself and those around me. Often, that means trying to find people to serve. There\u0026rsquo;s a quote that I like from a video about service called Lift. If you haven\u0026rsquo;t watched it, it\u0026rsquo;s only a few minutes long and well worth it. You can watch it here.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s interesting, the dichotomy between healing the body and healing the soul. When we heal the body, it\u0026rsquo;s always an inward effort. We\u0026rsquo;re always paying attention to ourselves. When we heal the soul, turning inward doesn\u0026rsquo;t work. And the triage of the soul is found in turning outward to other people.\n(Lift at ~7'14\u0026quot;)\nI am grateful for my faith because it doesn\u0026rsquo;t restrict me from things I want to do or coerce me into doing things I don\u0026rsquo;t want to do. It has taught me to tame my naturally destructive tendencies and to nurture my good impulses. It has made me happier, and has given me peace and direction in my life. I am a better person because of it.\nPhoto credit: Photo by Marcus Dall Col on Unsplash\n"},{"id":62,"href":"/posts/2017-11-18-drafting/","title":"Drafting","section":"Technical Blog","content":"I once asked my dad over email how to improve my the potency of my words and thoughts. His reply came back as one word:\nRevision.\nGood writing does not emerge spontaneously; it comes as one practices writing. A \u0026ldquo;draft\u0026rdquo; is a pass of writing a particular work. It\u0026rsquo;s like sketching in art: when an artist starts a painting, they usually start with a rough sketch outlining where the ﬁgures will be, what the landscape will be like, etc. These sketches are composed of many lines: each coming closer to their ﬁnal position.\nWhen I draft, I start out with a few different freewrites. I usually start with a stream of consciousness to get my ideas out on paper and to sort of flesh out what I actually want to talk about. Then I will beat out a very rough draft. After this initial draft, I usually will have a good idea of how I want to treat the subject matter. I will do things like read my paper aloud to hear how it flows, check for grammatical inconsistencies, look for more concise phrases that convey my ideas more clearly. Occasionally I will decide that I need to change how I structure my argument entirely. In these situations I will often do a complete rewrite.\nI usually use something akin to semantic versioning—the first version number of my draft indicates the major write of the paper, (e.g. 0.0.1 for the rough draft, 1.0.0 for the first full draft after the rough draft, 2.0.0 for the next full rewrite, etc.) the second number might indicate significant changes in the text, but not complete structural changes, and the third number indicates minor changes, such as spelling and grammar errors.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t follow this system too rigorously; it\u0026rsquo;s just a kind of fun thing I use to keep track of my drafts. My brain is messy some times, and I\u0026rsquo;m okay with that.\n"},{"id":63,"href":"/posts/2017-11-09-quick-website-programming-with-mojolicious-and-polymer/","title":"Rapid Website Development with Mojolicious and Polymer","section":"Technical Blog","content":"My girlfriend works for BYU SA—it\u0026rsquo;s the division of BYU that\u0026rsquo;s responsible for planning and running events.

I\u0026rsquo;m using the Docker image on a Digital Ocean droplet. Updating should be simple, I thought. I would take down the blog then spin it back up again after pulling down the latest Docker image. I ran docker stop ghost-blog, removed the container with docker rm ghost-blog then ran docker pull ghost:latest. The container came down without a problem.\nThen the trouble began.\nI tried restarting the image:\ndocker run -d --name ghost-blog -p 80:2368 -v /home/ghost/blog-data:/var/lib/ghost/content ghost But when I ran docker ps, no docker containers were running. I tried looking at the log of the ghost-blog container and was greeted with this message:\ntar: /var/lib/ghost/content.orig: Cannot open: No such file or directory tar: Error is not recoverable: exiting now tar: This does not look like a tar archive tar: Exiting with failure status due to previous errors Hhmmm… I tried creating /var/lib/ghost/content.orig, but that didn\u0026rsquo;t help. I then copied my blog-data/ folder, blew the old folder away, then tried running again, but to no avail.\nI was out of ideas, so I decided to inquire at the great oracle of DuckDuckGo. The first result was this lovely issue on GitHub that covered exactly the problem I was facing.\nI created the directory specified and was able to fire up the docker container without a problem. I think I must have made an incompatible upgrade. ¯_(ツ)_/¯\nBackup Woes # Running around as the root user of a system is always dangerous. I was painfully reminded of that today when I accidentally deleted my backup folder instead of moving its contents to the original location. 🤦🏻‍♂️Oops.\nFortunately, I had made another backup of all my content saved as a JSON file on my laptop. I fired up the docker container, opened to the website in a web browser, and imported all my old files. Day saved. 😌\nUnfortunately I lost all my configurations. Not that there was a lot, but I did loose the Disqus integration as well as some settings for me as an administrator. Alas. I\u0026rsquo;ll fix the comments sometime later. Probably after midterms…\nSo, lessons: make backups. Then don\u0026rsquo;t delete the backups.\nI am enjoying the Ghost blog. It\u0026rsquo;s pretty minimal and doesn\u0026rsquo;t get in my way.

Once you are defining a macro, hitting \u0026lt;f3\u0026gt; again will insert the current macro counter.\n\u0026lt;f4\u0026gt; is its best friend. Hitting \u0026lt;f4\u0026gt; while defining a macro will end the macro. Hitting \u0026lt;f4\u0026gt; otherwise will then run the last defined keyboard macro. Running C-u \u0026lt;f4\u0026gt; runs the second macro in macro ring. Running C-u 4 \u0026lt;f4\u0026gt; runs the first macro 4 times. (Adjust 4 as you will.)\nYou can use Lisp inside of a macro. For example, to insert incrementing numbers, do:\nM-: (setq x 1) RET C-( C-u M-: x RET M-: (setq x (+ x 1)) \u0026lt;whatever else\u0026gt; C-) You can repeat a macro until an error is signaled with C-u 0 C-x e.\nYou can also run apply-macro-to-region-lines (C-x C-k r) to fire a macro on every line in the region.\nTo prompt a user for input while writing a macro, do: C-u C-x q. This is a variant of C-x q which queries the user.\nRecursive editing # Hitting C-r will enter a recursive editing level when the macro is run, but not while you are recording.\nC-x q enters a query state: y continues to execute the macro, n aborts the current iteration, and q aborts all together.\nC-u C-x q lets you enter in some text.\nTo finish recursive editing, type C-M-c. To abort and halt execution, type C-].\nRectangles # To select text in a rectangle, use C-x SPC. The region will then highlight like a rectangle. The kill and yank commands will work like normal (i.e. hitting C-k will kill the rectangle.)\nC-x r M-w Copy rectangle as kill. (Think M-w)\nC-x r N Inserts numbered lines in the rectangle. Accepts a prefix argument to change at what number the lines start at.\nM-x string-insert-rectangle Prompts for a string and inserts it at the current rectangle. So you can go from this:\none two three four to this:\n- one - two - three - four by setting the mark on the o of one, then moving to the f in four, then running the command.\nMisc. Keystrokes # C-x \u0026lt;right arrow\u0026gt; cycle through buffers\nC-x C-q toggle read-only mode in current buffer\nC-x C-; to set comment column to cursor’s current column\nC-x C-h Really \u0026lt;any prefix\u0026gt; C-h shows a listing of all possible completions after the prefix character.\nC-x 8 RET Insert arbitary unicode character by name.

Good for focusing. Use C-x n w to display everything.\nC-x $ To hide lines in the current buffer, type ‘C-x $’ (‘set-selective-display’) with a numeric argument N. Then lines with at least N columns of indentation disappear from the screen.\nC-u Prefix argument. The default is 4.

It’s different for inserting digits. If you wanted to insert 5 seven times, type C-u 7 C-u 5.\nC-x C-k C-i Inserts the current value of the keyboard macro counter and increments it. When C-u proceeds the command, the previous value is inserted, and the counter is not updated. A prefix argument specifies a different increment.\nC-x C-k C-c Prompts for the initial value of the keyboard macro. Must be called prior to starting macro definition to be used this way. It has another behavior if called during macro definition. See this page for help.\nC-x C-k n Give the last kbd macro a name, which you can then call\nESC-^ Join this line to the previous and fix up whitespace at join.
