Three kinds of freedom:
 - Economic freedom. A freedom the spectre of poverty. Trump's platform.
 - Societal freedom. A freedom from social injustices. Also the presence of societal goods. Platform of the left.
 - Intellectual freedom. (I think this is the most important.) Think you want and run experiments. Includes religious freedom. This is the vehicle by which we arrive at the destinations the previous two kinds of freedom desire.
