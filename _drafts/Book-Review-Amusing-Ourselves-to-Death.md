## Notes

The typographical America read a lot.

### Telegraph

The telegraph *comoditized* information: news was suddenly taken out of context and held as valuable. *The Question*: if something is not relevant to my actions, can it still be valuable?

Page 69: Is the problem then in *unidirectional* means of communication? We can’t reply and can’t really engage. We become passive and the signal gets lost in the noise.

### Voting and Television

Page 135:
> As Xenophanes remarked twenty-five centuries ago, men always make their gods in their own image. But to this, television politics has added a new wrinkle: Those who would be gods refashion themselves into images the viewers would have them be.

Is this what gets Trump supporters so fanatic—to the point where they cannot see his lunacy? What image does he portray that they wish they had?

There’s a disregard for the status quo. He’s fiercely tribal—people want an enemy they can scapegoat, and he leads the charge against everyone and everything.
