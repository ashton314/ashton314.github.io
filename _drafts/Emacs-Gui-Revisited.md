title: Emacs GUI for iTerm2 addicts
---

Things that I missed from iTerm2:

 - A good shell (vterm)
 - Transparency
 - Fullscreen with Cmd-RET
 - Emoji support
 - Frames (tab-bar-mode)
 - Cursor guide
 - Colors (good theme *or* just change the background)
   + Also talk about opening up an older version of Emacs in your
     terminal and screen shotting/recoring all the color names to hex
     codes

<!-- Note: see other tab for spiritual thought -->
