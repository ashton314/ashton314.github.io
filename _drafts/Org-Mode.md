I'm a bit of a digital organization nut. Ever since I got my first personal digital device (a 4th-gen iPod Touch) I've been obsessed with keeping my notes, todo-lists, and calendars in some digital form. I tried using [Bullet Journal](https://bulletjournal.com/pages/learn) for a while and I liked it a lot. However, I didn't like carrying around a notebook with me all the time, and I missed digital indexing and being able to copy-paste web articles in with my notes. So, digital it is.[^1]

I'm still pretty young, but I feel like I've bounced around my fair share of platforms. I used [Evernote] for a long while, and I liked it. However, with some changes to their business and privacy models, I decided to switch off of that.

For the past few years most of my notes have lived in [Deft] in [Emacs]. I was pretty happy with how that was working. I wanted to find a solution for my todo lists though, especially for school assignments. I tried a few homework-tracking apps, but none really jived with me. I eventually tried using [Trello], and that worked pretty well for a few semesters.

Then I found Org-mode.

Other nice features:
 - Code blocks that you can eval
 - Smart lists
 - Heck, it even gives you spreadsheets
 - Solid knowledge base

[^1]: I would like to note that I am a avid advocate of taking class and meeting notes by hand. There have been [some studies] done that show that it is dramatically more effective.
