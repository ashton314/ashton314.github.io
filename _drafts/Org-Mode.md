I'm a bit of a digital organization nut. Ever since I got my first personal digital device (a 4th-gen iPod touch I think) I've been more or less obsessed with keeping my notes, todo-lists, and calendars in some digital form.

I'm still pretty young, but I feel like I've bounced around my fair share of platforms. I used [Evernote] for a long while, and I liked it. However, with some changes to their business and privacy models, I decided to switch off of that.

For the past few years most of my notes have lived in [Deft] in [Emacs]. I was pretty happy with how that was working. I wanted to find a solution for my todo lists though, especially for school assignments. I tried a few homework-tracking apps, but none really jived with me. I eventually tried using [Trello], and that worked pretty well for a few semesters.

Then I found Org-mode.
