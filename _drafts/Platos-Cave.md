title: "Plato's Cave"
---

The Greek philosopher Plato propounded a metaphor for life: we are all sitting in a cave watching shadows on the cave wall, cast from puppets back lit by a fire. What we perceive as real in the world is merely a projection or a shadow of the true reality.

We have all voluntarily put ourselves into Plato's cave.

Right now you are looking at a shadow on a wall. Well, in your case, your wall emits light rather than reflects it, and you follow the patterns of dark and light splotches.

We make so many decisions based off of the news that we hear and read on our phones. We have voluntarily elected to base most of our decisions off of what is fed into our senses by our cell phones and computers. Well this is an extraordinary communication medium, and we enjoy many benefits of being able to stay in contact with our friends and loved ones over great distances, this channel is unusually—perhaps, uniquely—susceptible to disruption and tampering.
