title: Thoughts on Java
---

I just finished the bulk of a semester-long project written in Java. It's for a software design class, and we were tuaght and expected to use various design principles found in the GOF *Design Patterns* book.

I have a few issues with using Java as a language for instruction.

I recognize that I'm probably pretty biased when it comes to this. Java is not the language I'm most familiar with, (though I'd say I'm slightly above average in terms of familiarity over my classmates—I'm not sure many of them know about the `Stream` library, for instance) and other languages like Racket and Elixir are much more familiar to me. Nevertheless, here is my opinion.

Writing my assignment in Java was difficult. I don't think the difficulty lay in the fact that the problem itself was hard—it was essentially a semi-RESTful glorified CRUD app hosted on AWS architecture, and I've written dozens of RESTful CRUD applications in various languages—but it was hard *because I was fighting Java the whole time*.

<blockquote class="callout">
If you're solving a problem in Java, and it's difficult, it's because *Java* itself makes many problems difficult to solve. In a language like Racket, the language fades away and you are left *struggling with the problem itself* rather than the *constraints of the language*.
</blockquote>

## Why should I care?

Language is important, be it human or machine related. The language we use shapes our thoughts and can constrain what we think and say.
