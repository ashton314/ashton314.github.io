title: FreeBSD on a Raspberry Pi
tags: freebsd, tools
---

I'm a FreeBSD guy. My first computer was a FreeBSD machine that my dad had running in a closet. I learned how to use Emacs as well as the command line on that black-screen white-text no-mouse interface. That's how real programmers spend their childhood! ðŸ˜Ž ðŸ˜œ

I've only heard good things about FreeBSD. While not known as particularly desktop-friendly (various Linux distros win here) I've heard tales of its rock-solid stability. I wanted to try running on FreeBSD again, just to see what all the fuss was about.

Installing
==========

Installing was relatively straight forward. I followed the instructions
[here](https://wiki.freebsd.org/action/show/arm/Raspberry%20Pi?action=show&redirect=FreeBSD%2Farm%2FRaspberry+Pi).

Once I got the card flashed (took about an hour) and booted, I reset the
passwords for users `root` and `freebsd`. Note that at time of writing
WiFi wasn't supported; I had to hard-link an Ethernet cable. It found
the connection without any trouble, so that was nice.

Initial Setup
=============

Setting up the clock
--------------------

<https://www.freebsd.org/doc/handbook/network-ntp.html>

The clock is necessary to start working with the ports. Set the config
variables in `/etc/rc.conf`:

```conf
ntpd_enable=YES
ntpd_sync_on_start=YES  # This one might not be necessary
```

You should be able to just run this without rebooting. (I ended up
rebooting, but I think I did things out of order.)

```bash
service ntpd start
```

Installing the port tree
------------------------

<https://www.freebsd.org/doc/handbook/ports-using.html>

Run the following: (I think you can do this in any directory)

```bash
portsnap fetch
portsnap extract
```

Installing the critical tools: Emacs and Git
============================================

I tried going into `/usr/ports/editors/emacs/` and running
`make install`, but I must have had an option wrong because it tried
installing... I think the entire X Windowing System. Yikes.

I gave up after about a day and instead ran `pkg install emacs-nox` and
`pkg install git`; those ran pretty quickly.
