DuckDuckGo is a search engine. Like Google Search, you just throw some keywords into a box and get a list of results. Lots of people use Google, but I don't. DuckDuckGo works better for me, and this is why.

## Consistent Results

Did you know that Google will give you different search results, based on who you are and what you have searched for in the past? This is called a [filter bubble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filter_bubble), and it's [annoying and dangerous](https://spreadprivacy.com/google-filter-bubble-study/). DuckDuckGo doesn't put you in a filter bubble.

## Goodies and Tools

Oh, man do I love the tools DuckDuckGo gives software developers. Here are just a few.

#### Software Development

- Need to find a color? Search "color picker". A built-in color picker pops up.
- Want to know the HTML character entity for, say, the interrobang? (â€½) Type "HTML entity â€½"
- Got some JSON that you need to prettify? Search "json validator" for a validator and beautifier.
- Searching Stack Overflow, Mozilla Developer Network, etc. with Bangs! (more later)
- Keybinding references for Emacs, Vim, Bash, etc.

#### Entertainment

- Need to play 2048? Yes, just search "2048" and an in-browser game pops up.
- Today's XKCD (search "xkcd")
- Cheat sheets for Kerbal Space Program, Minecraft, League of Legends, etc.

#### Bangs

Perform special operations by putting the appropriate !-sequence at the beginning of your search.

- `!yt` Search YouTube ("!yt glitter bomb package")
- `!a` Search Amazon
- `!w` Search Wikipedia
- `!mdn` Search Mozilla Developer Network
- `!unsplash` Search Unsplash photos
- `!img` Search Google imagesâ€”proxied for you so you can keep your privacy
- `!ldss` Search LDS Scriptures (just found this one ðŸ¤¯

There are thousands. Literally.

#### Misc.

- Generate Lorem Ipsum filler text by searching "lorem ipsum"
- Check the weather with "weather `<zipcode>/<city name>`"
- Calculator with "calculator"

It's incredible. It's simple. Perhaps best of all, ad-free! Well, they do display ads based on your search term for _just that search_. They don't track you. The ads are not customized to _you_, rather they are customized to your _search_. They're not intrusive either. I forgot they were there until I was typing this. ðŸ˜„

But seriously. DuckDuckGo is amazing. Give it a try.

You can even enable it as your default search engine on iOS. Go to Settings \> Safari \> Search Engine and select DuckDuckGo. You can set it as well in Safari on desktop, as well as Firefox. (I don't use Chrome or Edge, though I imagine they'd let you do the same. Comment below if you find anything out.
