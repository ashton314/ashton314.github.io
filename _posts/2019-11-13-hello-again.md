Hello again.

Welcome to my new blog. I gave up on Ghost, and I switched over to Jekyll. It's a lot more customizable and will suit my needs.

You might notice that the pages load very quickly. This is a staticly-generated site, so everything should be nice and zippy.

> This file is to test some styles.

Now for some `inline code`, and don't forget a code block:

```racket
(define (factorial n)
  (if (= n 0) 1 (* n (factorial (- n 1)))))
```

And try [a link](https://github.com/ashton314).
