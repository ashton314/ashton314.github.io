      <h1>This Too Shall Pass</h1>
      <p>It&rsquo;s cliché at this point to say that 2020 was a rough year. I&rsquo;m grateful in that I and my wife were relatively unscathed by the pandemic. I had some personal health issues however that by themselves made 2020 a bit of a struggle. I learned some important lessons.</p>
<p>In February I had a big choir concert. That same weekend I had a large project for one of my CS classes due. I got an extension on my CS project so I could sing in the concert; but despite the extension, I was rushed and I spent an unusually long time in front of my computer working on my project after the concert was over.</p>
<p>Due to the nature of the project, I had to use a mouse for much of it. The strain of pronation<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> for such a long time did something in my right forearm. The next day I felt an ache every time I tried to turn my hands downward: even with a 15° tent on my split keyboard, I couldn&rsquo;t lay my hands down to type. I felt a burning along the inside of my forearm whenever I tried. My grip was shot as well: I wasn&rsquo;t able to open any tight jars, and I had to use my left hand for a lot of things that I normally would use my right hand for.</p>
<p>I, at age 23, had developed a repetitive-strain injury.</p>
<p>I went to a physical therapist. An ultrasound revealed no issues with my nerves. I was really happy about that because it meant that I didn&rsquo;t need surgery. But I did need some non-surgical intervention: after many weeks of rest from work and several visits to a physical therapist, my hand started feeling a little better.</p>
<p>After a month or so I was able to start going back to work. I started at working a few hours here and there, and over the course of a few months scaled back up to something close to what my hours normally were. I was extra-vigilant in doing my stretches and exercises that I had gotten from the physical therapist. Things were looking up.</p>
<p>Then it started hurting again.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t take much: just a small deviation from my workout and a little added stress on my hands sent me back to the doctor. Some more deep-muscle massages and another break from work helped me to get back on track. But I was feeling shaken and a little depressed.</p>
<p>This cycle happened again a few more times. Each time, I wondered if I would ever be back to &ldquo;normal&rdquo; when I didn&rsquo;t have to worry so much about my hands.</p>
<p>I had been on the mend for a while and was feeling pretty happy about where I was. I invested in a new split keyboard that had more buttons for my thumbs which took the strain off of my pinky fingers. I switched to Vim-bindings in Emacs<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> and made a concerted effort to avoid the mouse.</p>
<p>Then I started running.</p>
<p>I found a trail close by to where I live: it&rsquo;s shady and pretty level. Running had always been my <em>least</em> favorite form of exercise, but I discovered that I actually <em>enjoyed</em> it.</p>
<p>After just a few days, I noticed that my hands were feeling better than they ever had before. I think the cardio helped my hands get some more blood that they had been missing. My hands still feel great. Some days I don&rsquo;t think about the fact that they were injured, which is a miracle.</p>
<p>Then, after my first 5k, I got a bad case of runner&rsquo;s knee.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still feeling it. It&rsquo;s been a few days, and even walking has been has been a little painful. I think I pushed it too hard too quickly. I&rsquo;m not great at this physical training thing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve lost (temporarily) the form of exercise that I was <em>just</em> starting to enjoy. But something that I&rsquo;ve learned from cycles of health and injury is that bad times come… and they also go. In the case of my hands, it took well over a year for me to feel like I was in a more normal place. I still feel like I&rsquo;m on the mend—I still have a hard time using the keyboard on my laptop—but I&rsquo;m optimistic that <em>this time</em> the worst is behind me, at least for the next few years.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still young, and I&rsquo;m only just getting used to the idea that injuries don&rsquo;t heal as well as they do when you&rsquo;re a kid. It&rsquo;s been a bit of a struggle to come to grips with that idea, but I&rsquo;m getting there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always the best of times, as well as the worst of times. I&rsquo;ve watched my wife, parents, and friends go through similar seasons of difficulty—sometimes spanning years of distress—only to emerge triumphant in some cases, or adapt when the difficulties never pass fully.</p>
<p>I believe there is hope. I&rsquo;m thankful for my family and my faith which helped carry me though these hard times. I know more will come, but I know I will make it through.</p>
