      <description>About Me # I&amp;rsquo;m a PhD student at the University of Utah studying programming languages with Ben Greenman. I live in Salt Lake City.
My most recent place of employment outside of academia was with Spiff, where they were nice enough to let me hack on their interpreter. Before Spiff I worked at a few other positions as a full-stack engineer.
I&amp;rsquo;ve sung with the BYU Men&amp;rsquo;s Chorus and I play the piano.</description>
