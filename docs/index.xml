      <description>About Me I&amp;#39;ve sung with the BYU Men&amp;#39;s Chorus and I play the piano. Other hobbies include swimming and hikingâ€”Utah has some of the most diverse landscape anywhere in the US: from dense forests to barren desert. If you visit, I highly recommend checking out some of the national parks.
I have been married to my wife Sarah since 2018; we met when we were in high school and she&amp;#39;s been my best friend ever since.</description>
