      <description>An analogy occurred to me this evening as I was thinking about programming language design:
 Choosing good keywords and function names is like picking a good font; the ideas conveyed may be the same, but a change can drastically impact legibility and enjoyment of use.
 PHP does a spectacular job of providing a bad example. It&amp;rsquo;s like the Comic Sans of programming languages. Now there are many reasons why PHP is not a good languageâ€”I&amp;rsquo;d like to investigate this particular aspect of its design here briefly.</description>
