        <description>This week I created a custom build of the Iosevka font. I&amp;#39;ve used Input Mono for a long time now, and was very happy with it. However, it was missing a few glyphs that I wanted to use. Moreover, I didn&amp;#39;t have a license for the Input font to use on e.g. my blog. Iosevka is stupendously customizable, so I thought I&amp;#39;d see if I could get something close to Input&amp;#39;s styles.</description>

        <description>An analogy occurred to me this evening as I was thinking about programming language design:
Choosing good keywords and function names is like picking a good font; the ideas conveyed may be the same, but a change can drastically impact legibility and enjoyment of use.
PHP does a spectacular job of providing a bad example. It&amp;rsquo;s like the Comic Sans of programming languages. Now there are many reasons why PHP is not a good languageâ€”I&amp;rsquo;d like to investigate this particular aspect of its design here briefly.</description>
