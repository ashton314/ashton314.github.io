      <description>Something I learned today from a coworker: if you turn your monitor sideways, subpixel anti-aliasing gets completely broken. This isn&amp;#39;t as much of an issue on today&amp;#39;s high-dpi displays, but for anything lower than a 4k screen, the effect can be noticeable.
Just a little interesting thing I learned today. Thanks to my good, knowledgeable friend and coworker Jonner Steck!
Also, while we&amp;#39;re on the topic of font rendering, I&amp;#39;ve updated Iosevka Output to more closely match Input Mono: the cross-bar on the f now lines up nicely with the x-height.</description>

      <description>This week I created a custom build of the Iosevka font. I&amp;#39;ve used Input Mono for a long time now, and was very happy with it. However, it was missing a few glyphs that I wanted to use. Moreover, I didn&amp;#39;t have a license for the Input font to use on e.g. my blog. Iosevka is stupendously customizable, so I thought I&amp;#39;d see if I could get something close to Input&amp;#39;s styles.</description>
