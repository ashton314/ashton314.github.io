      <description>μKanren (&amp;ldquo;micro-Kanren&amp;rdquo;) is a tiny, embeddable logic programming language. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to understand and implement in almost any language. It&amp;rsquo;s a great case study of an embedded language: unlike other common &amp;ldquo;embedded&amp;rdquo; languages like SQL or regex, which normally are represented as just plain-old strings, μKanren takes more advantage of the host language&amp;rsquo;s features.
I recommend reading the original paper: it&amp;rsquo;s short, well-written, and easy to understand.
I did a write-up which you can read on Sourcehut.</description>

      <description>My wife and I got a chance to go to a place that lets you paint pottery and then have it fired. The pottery is all pre-made; you just get to paint it.
It&amp;rsquo;s been a very long time since I&amp;rsquo;ve worked with a physical art medium, so the mug looks kinda dumpy. I did alright with the Racket logo on the bottom-inside of the mug though!
I&amp;rsquo;m working on some fun projects with Racket.</description>
