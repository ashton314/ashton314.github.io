      <title>How, Where, and Why I Take Notes</title>
      <link>https://lambdaland.org/posts/2024-07-29_note_mediums/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I take a blend of digital and hand-written notes. It&amp;rsquo;s a bit of a hodgepodge, but it&amp;rsquo;s working. I used to lean heavily into full-digital notes, but I started drifting towards a mixture of digital and hand-written notes. Initially it was complicated, but I think I&amp;rsquo;m converging on a good setup. What I describe here will continue to evolve I am sure, but I am enjoying where it&amp;rsquo;s currently at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;pen-and-paper-is-best-for-thinking&#34;&gt;
  Pen and paper is best for thinking
  &lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#pen-and-paper-is-best-for-thinking&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve fallen down the fountain pen rabbit hole. I used to write with a Pilot G2 pen, and I loved how dark ink was. The primary drawback was that it bled through the paper of my Leuchtturm notebooks a little bit. I also had some problems with the extra-fine 0.38 pens: after a few months of use, they&amp;rsquo;d break before all the gel ink had been expended. This was frustrating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I write with a Lamy Al-Star with an extra-fine nib. I use Pilot&amp;rsquo;s black &lt;em&gt;take-sumi iroshizuku&lt;/em&gt; ink. It is &lt;em&gt;lovely&lt;/em&gt; to write with this pen. Compared to the G2, the fountain pen writes just as fine as the 0.38 G2, but the ink doesn&amp;rsquo;t skip, the tip never breaks, and the ink doesn&amp;rsquo;t bleed through the paper at all. Sure, the fountain pen requires a little more maintenance than a gel or ballpoint pen, but it is fun to have a little mechanical thing to maintain and form simple rituals around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting the fountain pen had the curious effect of making me want to take &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; notes by hand. I started writing a lot more. But I have a bunch of infrastructure set up for digital note taking, so when I initially started writing more, I would get a little lost as to where I had put certain notes. I didn&amp;rsquo;t like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did find that I enjoyed writing my thoughts out—it was like doing a one-person rubber-duck session. I strongly believe that writing helps you think: it forces you to be explicit with your thoughts and it helps you notice gaps in your thinking. This can push you to answer questions that you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have asked otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;quasi-digital-for-classes&#34;&gt;
  Quasi-digital for classes
  &lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#quasi-digital-for-classes&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In class I take notes on an iPad with an Apple Pencil. I like that I can keep all my notes for all my classes with me at all times. I also like that I can write in different colors when needed, the ability to download or take a picture of a slide and mark it up, or do some lightweight diagraming. I feel like it gives me the best of both worlds: I get the storage, versatility, and searchability of digital notes, but I get the memory benefits of handwritten notes since I am &lt;em&gt;writing&lt;/em&gt; rather than &lt;em&gt;typing&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;full-digital-for-research&#34;&gt;
  Full digital for research
  &lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#full-digital-for-research&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;marginnote&#34;&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Backlinks:&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;The set of notes that link &lt;em&gt;to&lt;/em&gt; a given note. Suppose note A has a link to note B. If I am looking at note B, then A will be in the set of B&amp;rsquo;s backlinks.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever I have something that I am researching, I typically keep notes in a plain-text file on my computer. (I use &lt;a href=&#34;https://orgmode.org/&#34;&gt;org-mode&lt;/a&gt; most of the time, naturally.) This lets me link and search through my notes really easily. Being on a computer means that it is easy to copy-paste things I want to remember and then store links to recover the source. I use &lt;a href=&#34;https://protesilaos.com/emacs/denote&#34;&gt;Denote&lt;/a&gt; to organize my notes; Denote lets me format my notes consistently, as well as recover backlinks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;marginnote&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fun aside: I recently &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/commit/4318efe7e8ce2bcd2cafa386a903054273203fd5&#34;&gt;contributed some code to Denote&lt;/a&gt; that adds an indicator in the mode-line if the currently-visited note has a backlink. I like getting a heads-up that there&amp;rsquo;s some digging to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also will put notes that I made by hand during a thinking session into my Denote files after they&amp;rsquo;ve had a little time to marinate in my head. I will typically use this step to flesh out ideas that I only got in skeleton form in my notebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really like Denote: it is simple, requires no external dependencies, and it plays nicely with synching systems. Today, thanks to my tag system, links, backlinks, and some searching, I ran into some notes I had taken a year ago and forgot about—but now these notes are helping me with my work right now!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary-what-i-write-and-where&#34;&gt;
  Summary: what I write and where
  &lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#summary-what-i-write-and-where&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After thinking a little bit about what mode of note taking benefits most from a given medium, I came up with the following system for myself:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Meeting with my advisor&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;I take meeting notes by hand on paper, usually in my notebook.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Thinking through something&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Again, hand-written, usually on my Rhodia pads as these are typically ephemeral notes. If I get a good idea, I&amp;rsquo;ll write it down in my notebook and then transfer it to my digital Denote notes later.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Reading notes&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;If I am reading a technical paper or book that I want to understand, I&amp;rsquo;ll take these notes in my notebook.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Research lab notes&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Digital. I have a template that I fill out every day that helps me keep track of basic information and links all of my daily lab notes to a big note for the whole project. This makes it easy for me to go to that project note and flip through the backlinks.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Class notes&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;While I only have one more class left, I still take class notes on my iPad. I feel like class notes benefit the most from a digital-handwriting hybrid.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should you adopt the setup I have? No. You should arrive to your own system yourself. The only thing I would advise anyone to take from my experience is that you should put a little time and effort into being &lt;em&gt;intentional&lt;/em&gt; about how you take notes and how your organize them. You need to find a system that works for &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;, and only &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; can do the work to make that happen.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A New Font</title>
      <link>https://lambdaland.org/posts/2022-08-01_a_new_font/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://lambdaland.org/posts/2022-08-01_a_new_font/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I created a custom build of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/be5invis/Iosevka&#34;&gt;Iosevka&lt;/a&gt; font. I&amp;rsquo;ve used &lt;a href=&#34;https://input.djr.com/&#34;&gt;Input Mono&lt;/a&gt; for a long time now, and was very happy with it. However, it was missing a few glyphs that I wanted to use. Moreover, I didn&amp;rsquo;t have a license for the Input font to use on e.g. my blog. Iosevka is &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/be5invis/Iosevka/blob/master/doc/custom-build.md&#34;&gt;stupendously customizable&lt;/a&gt;, so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d see if I could get something close to Input&amp;rsquo;s styles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iosevka&amp;rsquo;s default style is &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; narrow. However, I discovered that the width of Iosevka &lt;em&gt;extended&lt;/em&gt; at 13pt matched Input at 12pt exactly. Here&amp;rsquo;s a side-by-side comparison: the first picture is with Input Mono, and the second is with my new &lt;a href=&#34;https://codeberg.org/ashton314/iosevka-output&#34;&gt;Iosevka Output&lt;/a&gt; font:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://lambdaland.org/img/input_view.png&#34;
    alt=&#34;Figure 1: Input Mono at 12pt font&#34;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;figure-number&#34;&gt;Figure 1: &lt;/span&gt;Input Mono at 12pt font&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://lambdaland.org/img/iosevka_view.png&#34;
    alt=&#34;Figure 2: Iosevka Output at 13pt font&#34;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;figure-number&#34;&gt;Figure 2: &lt;/span&gt;Iosevka Output at 13pt font&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I loose a few lines with the Iosevka font, but that&amp;rsquo;s a deliberate choice as its ascenders are pretty tall. I originally had &lt;code&gt;leading = 1100&lt;/code&gt; in the build plan, which matched Input exactly, but I decided that this was more legible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wasn&amp;rsquo;t that hard either. Turns out, there&amp;rsquo;s a predefined stylistic set (&lt;code&gt;ss18&lt;/code&gt;) that matches almost all the Input characters well. Some features that I made sure were present:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Double-storey &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;g&lt;/code&gt;: I find this more legible as I don&amp;rsquo;t mistake these characters for &lt;code&gt;o&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt; respectively.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tailed-and-serif &lt;code&gt;l&lt;/code&gt;: the curved bottom differentiates it clearly from &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;I&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Term&amp;rdquo;-style spacing: I didn&amp;rsquo;t like characters such as &lt;code&gt;→&lt;/code&gt; taking up more than a single character&amp;rsquo;s width. Looks pretty, but messes up some of my UI elements.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few more tweaks that I&amp;rsquo;ve made to the font, and I&amp;rsquo;m likely to tweak it some more. I&amp;rsquo;m still getting used to this Iosevka style, but I&amp;rsquo;m going to drive it for a week or so to give it a fair shake. It&amp;rsquo;s growing on me for sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to try it out, head over to &lt;a href=&#34;https://codeberg.org/ashton314/iosevka-output/&#34;&gt;my Codeberg repo&lt;/a&gt; and download the build artifact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;building-iosevka&#34;&gt;
  Building Iosevka
  &lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#building-iosevka&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll need &lt;code&gt;nodejs&lt;/code&gt; (ugh) and &lt;code&gt;ttfautohint&lt;/code&gt; installed. See the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/be5invis/Iosevka/blob/master/doc/custom-build.md&#34;&gt;docs for custom Iosevka builds&lt;/a&gt; for more details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you clone the Iosevka repository, be sure to not clone all 20 Gb of history:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#d8dee9;background-color:#2e3440;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;git clone --depth &lt;span style=&#34;color:#b48ead&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; https://github.com/be5invis/Iosevka
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you&amp;rsquo;ve got the build repo cloned, copy my &lt;code&gt;private-build-plans.toml&lt;/code&gt; file into the root of the Iosevka directory, and run according to the directions in the Iosevka project.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Ode to Used Book Stores</title>
      <link>https://lambdaland.org/posts/2021-08-03_used_books/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 03 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://lambdaland.org/posts/2021-08-03_used_books/</guid>
      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I get a little money I buy books; and if any is left I buy food and clothes.&lt;br&gt;
— Erasmus of Rotterdam&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Used bookstores are my arch nemesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have two such stores in disturbingly close proximity to me. The first is Boomerang Books—within a short walk of my house and right next to Burgers Supreme (almost as dangerous)—and they carry textbooks at a fifth of the original price. Last time I went there I walked out with a book on graph theory I most certainly don&amp;rsquo;t need. The second is Pioneer Book. My wife and I went there on a date a couple of months ago. I walked out with a dozen books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My wallet has suffered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What keeps me hooked is that my wallet has suffered &lt;em&gt;much less&lt;/em&gt; than it would if they were not used books, though!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The serendipity is what gets me. I was walking up the stairs when I passed a copy of &lt;em&gt;Walden&lt;/em&gt; be Emerson that was waiting to be sorted and shelved. I picked it up and added it to the pile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not sure how much more my bookshelf can take. The books are already stacked two deep. I just need to make time, dig in, and start reading. Maybe I can give back some of those wonderful books after I&amp;rsquo;ve finished them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Marked Man</title>
      <link>https://lambdaland.org/posts/2019-01-24-marked-man/</link>

      <guid>https://lambdaland.org/posts/2019-01-24-marked-man/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Marked Man (mm) is a little program I wrote to view Markdown files like UNIX man pages. (Because who wants to leave their terminal just to open a file?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It uses &lt;a href=&#34;https://pandoc.org&#34;&gt;Pandoc&lt;/a&gt; to convert between Markdown and the &lt;code&gt;groff&lt;/code&gt; format. As a happy side-effect, this program can read basically &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; as a man page: HTML, LaTeX, Word files (seriously), ePub, etc. Anything that Pandoc can read, Marked Man can handle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m working on getting this set up with &lt;a href=&#34;brew.sh&#34;&gt;Homebrew&lt;/a&gt;. For now, check out my GitHub repository &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/ashton314/homebrew-mm&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
