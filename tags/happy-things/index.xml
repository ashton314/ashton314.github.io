        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I get a little money I buy books; and if any is left I buy food and clothes.&lt;br&gt;
â€” Erasmus of Rotterdam&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Used bookstores are my arch nemesis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>Marked Man (mm) is a little program I wrote to view Markdown files like UNIX man pages. (Because who wants to leave their terminal just to open a file?)
It uses Pandoc to convert between Markdown and the groff format. As a happy side-effect, this program can read basically anything as a man page: HTML, LaTeX, Word files (seriously), ePub, etc. Anything that Pandoc can read, Marked Man can handle.</description>

        <description>September 30th marked two years since I arrived home from serving a two-year mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The mission is colloquially referred to as &amp;ldquo;the best two years&amp;rdquo;. (There is a movie about missionaries, which I have not seen, by this title.)
My time on the mission did constitute the best two years of my life. I grew and learned so much in that time.</description>
