        <description>I have a hard time keeping these terms straight:
liveness vs. safety soundness vs. completeness This is intended as a short guide for myself; maybe someone else will find it useful too! Note that this is all to the best of my knowledge and understanding at the present time; if there be faults, they be the faults of myself. I welcome correction and clarification if I am wrong.
Liveness vs. Safety Liveness and safety deal with properties of a system.</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Control-Flow Analysis is a popular technique for performing static analysis of many different kinds of programming languages.
It&amp;rsquo;s most often needed in cases where you have some kind of dynamic dispatch: either where you have first-class functions or when you have objects and you call one of their methods.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
