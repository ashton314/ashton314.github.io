      <description>I started my PhD program about a year ago. In my first year I have:
Taken 4 &amp;ldquo;normal&amp;rdquo; 3-credit-hour classes Participated in 3 seminars Switched advisors Attended 2 conferences (PLDI @ FCRC, JuliaCon) Presented my work at JuliaCon It&amp;rsquo;s been a lot of work, and there&amp;rsquo;s been a lot of stress. I&amp;rsquo;m in a much better place now than when I started, and over all I&amp;rsquo;m happy where I&amp;rsquo;m at and where I&amp;rsquo;m headed.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A collection of what worked well and what didn&amp;rsquo;t in classes that I took this semester. This is partially for me to record what things reduced friction for me as a student so that one day, should I become a professor, I&amp;rsquo;ll be able to run the lowest-friction class ever!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>The following is from a essay from a class on German literature and film.

Enter: the spare raspberry pi I have sitting around.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
