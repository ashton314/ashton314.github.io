      <description>All mail clients suck. This one just sucks less.
â€” Mutt
 I was a long-time mutt user. Come to think of it, I think the reason why I learned Emacs was because that was what $EDITOR was set to, and I needed to know how to get around so I could send email via mutt.
As more of my life has gotten sucked into Emacs, I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted to move my email into Emacs as well.</description>
