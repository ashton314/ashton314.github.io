      <description>I recently managed to get access to my Outlook email from Emacs. This took some doing as my university had disabled app passwords. I consider Outlook to be harmful, but inasmuch as companies and schools continue to enforce OAUTH-only authentication with email systems, it is good to find workarounds.
This is how I set up email sending/receiving on my computer running macOS with DavMail. I also use mbsync (confusingly also known as isync) to actually fetch my email, and mu/mu4e to index and read mail.</description>

      <description>It&amp;#39;s hard to overstate how important email is in our modern world. Even as hip new platforms like Slack &amp;amp;co. gain traction in the workplace, so much communication takes place in a crusty old medium that&amp;#39;s outlived every purported &amp;#34;email killer&amp;#34;. Where does it get its staying power from?
Email predates much of the Internet as we know it today. Its current incarnation first emerged in the early 80s, though it has roots in earlier forms of digital messaging from as far back as the 60s.</description>
