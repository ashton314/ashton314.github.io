      <description>What does this program do? At the most reduced level, one could say that a program&amp;rsquo;s behavior is defined by the effect it has on the hardware running it. That&amp;rsquo;s not very useful however; when we&amp;rsquo;re programming, we often have to deal with legacy code and tease out the original intent of the code.
Saying that the meaning of a program is entirely encapsulated by the code is saying that the intent and the implementation are the same.</description>
