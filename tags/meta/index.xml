      <description>I got Disqus working! You&amp;rsquo;ll notice at the bottom of the page is now a place to leave comments.
Disqus has their privacy policy here. They make money through advertising, which is unfortunate, because that means they&amp;rsquo;re selling some of your (and my) data to third parties. That&amp;rsquo;s pretty common these days. :-/

      <description>Ever since returning home from my mission to Germany in September of 2016, I have tried to to reduce how much I have interacted with Facebook. It is not a platform for writing, which is what I want to do. I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to use a blog for the sake of publishing my ideas.
I&amp;rsquo;ll write more about this later…</description>

      <description>Hello. My name is Ashton Wiersdorf. I usually introduce myself with my first and last name, and a firm handshake. Since we&amp;rsquo;re interacting via the Internet, I&amp;rsquo;ll forgo that step of my customary greeting. I am a student studying computer science at Brigham Young University. More about me later…</description>
