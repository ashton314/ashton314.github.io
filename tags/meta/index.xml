      <description>Yes, it&amp;rsquo;s time to redo my blog again.
This time I found an ultra light-weight blog theme. This page here is under 100KB!
I wanted to make something that acts more like a homepage for my research, rather than a blog. I still have all my blog posts, but now the focus will be on a more professional presentation of my work.
This theme is really what I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted all along: a home page with a max-width for the text, table of contents, and built-in local search!</description>

      <description>Brief update on the blog: I had been running a custom fork of the Anatole theme; it diverged pretty heavily, and I found a nice way to customize the CSS. Behold! The new-and-improved blog.
Some of the new extensions to Anatole include the ability to set a static page as your profile; I&amp;rsquo;ll do this and include links to lists of publications and whatnot. This should make my blog a better place for my professional/academic life.</description>

      <description>I got Disqus working! You&amp;rsquo;ll notice at the bottom of the page is now a place to leave comments.
Disqus has their privacy policy here. They make money through advertising, which is unfortunate, because that means they&amp;rsquo;re selling some of your (and my) data to third parties. That&amp;rsquo;s pretty common these days. :-/
If you don&amp;rsquo;t want to be tracked, you can enable content blockers in Safari by going to Preferences (âŒ˜-,) &amp;gt; Websites &amp;gt; Content Blockers and toggling the blocker:</description>
