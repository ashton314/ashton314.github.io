<meta name="description" content="It&rsquo;s my first Christmas being a dad. The end of the school semester was unusually stressful; I didn&rsquo;t have much time or energy to anticipate Christmas. But I&rsquo;ve felt a marked lack of eagerness for getting presents. That feeling wanes each year—something I&rsquo;m grateful for—but this year I only felt an eagerness for a time of peace and celebration with my family. Peaceful it has been.
My family isn&rsquo;t perfect. (My baby daughter is about as perfect as they come, though!) The time I&rsquo;ve gotten to spend so far and the time that I will spend with them is precious to me. My wife and I have focused so much on celebrating the birth of Jesus Christ that this commercialized junk we put up with has been all but absent from our home. We have a few books about Santa Claus that we read to our daughter, but we&rsquo;ve listened to strictly Christ-centered music. (A Charlie Brown Christmas counts, though!) There&rsquo;s been a spirit in our home that has brought me comfort and peace in this tumultuous year—more than any before it.">

<p>It&rsquo;s my first Christmas being a dad. The end of the school semester was unusually stressful; I didn&rsquo;t have much time or energy to anticipate Christmas. But I&rsquo;ve felt a marked lack of eagerness for <em>getting</em> presents. That feeling wanes each year—something I&rsquo;m grateful for—but this year I only felt an eagerness for a time of peace and celebration with my family. Peaceful it has been.</p>
<p>My family isn&rsquo;t perfect. (My baby daughter is about as perfect as they come, though!) The time I&rsquo;ve gotten to spend so far and the time that I will spend with them is precious to me. My wife and I have focused so much on celebrating the birth of Jesus Christ that this commercialized junk we put up with has been all but absent from our home. We have a few books about Santa Claus that we read to our daughter, but we&rsquo;ve listened to strictly Christ-centered music. (<em>A Charlie Brown Christmas</em> counts, though!) There&rsquo;s been a spirit in our home that has brought me comfort and peace in this tumultuous year—more than any before it.</p>
<p>Merry Christmas—may the peace of God be with you.</p>
