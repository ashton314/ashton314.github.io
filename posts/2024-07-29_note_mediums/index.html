<p>I take a blend of digital and hand-written notes. It&rsquo;s a bit of a hodgepodge, but it&rsquo;s working. I used to lean heavily into full-digital notes, but I started drifting towards a mixture of digital and hand-written notes. Initially it was complicated, but I think I&rsquo;m converging on a good setup. What I describe here will continue to evolve I am sure, but I am enjoying where it&rsquo;s currently at.</p>

</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve fallen down the fountain pen rabbit hole. I used to write with a Pilot G2 pen, and I loved how dark ink was. The primary drawback was that it bled through the paper of my Leuchtturm notebooks a little bit. I also had some problems with the extra-fine 0.38 pens: after a few months of use, they&rsquo;d break before all the gel ink had been expended. This was frustrating.</p>
<p>Now I write with a Lamy Al-Star with an extra-fine nib. I use Pilot&rsquo;s black <em>take-sumi iroshizuku</em> ink. It is <em>lovely</em> to write with this pen. Compared to the G2, the fountain pen writes just as fine as the 0.38 G2, but the ink doesn&rsquo;t skip, the tip never breaks, and the ink doesn&rsquo;t bleed through the paper at all. Sure, the fountain pen requires a little more maintenance than a gel or ballpoint pen, but it is fun to have a little mechanical thing to maintain and form simple rituals around.</p>
<p>Getting the fountain pen had the curious effect of making me want to take <em>more</em> notes by hand. I started writing a lot more. But I have a bunch of infrastructure set up for digital note taking, so when I initially started writing more, I would get a little lost as to where I had put certain notes. I didn&rsquo;t like that.</p>
<p>I did find that I enjoyed writing my thoughts out—it was like doing a one-person rubber-duck session. I strongly believe that writing helps you think: it forces you to be explicit with your thoughts and it helps you notice gaps in your thinking. This can push you to answer questions that you wouldn&rsquo;t have asked otherwise.</p>

<p>In class I take notes on an iPad with an Apple Pencil. I like that I can keep all my notes for all my classes with me at all times. I also like that I can write in different colors when needed, the ability to download or take a picture of a slide and mark it up, or do some lightweight diagraming. I feel like it gives me the best of both worlds: I get the storage, versatility, and searchability of digital notes, but I get the memory benefits of handwritten notes since I am <em>writing</em> rather than <em>typing</em>.</p>

<div class="marginnote">
<dl>
<dt>Backlinks:</dt>
<dd>The set of notes that link <em>to</em> a given note. Suppose note A has a link to note B. If I am looking at note B, then A will be in the set of B&rsquo;s backlinks.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<p>Whenever I have something that I am researching, I typically keep notes in a plain-text file on my computer. (I use <a href="https://orgmode.org/">org-mode</a> most of the time, naturally.) This lets me link and search through my notes really easily. Being on a computer means that it is easy to copy-paste things I want to remember and then store links to recover the source. I use <a href="https://protesilaos.com/emacs/denote">Denote</a> to organize my notes; Denote lets me format my notes consistently, as well as recover backlinks.</p>
<div class="marginnote">
<p>Fun aside: I recently <a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/commit/4318efe7e8ce2bcd2cafa386a903054273203fd5">contributed some code to Denote</a> that adds an indicator in the mode-line if the currently-visited note has a backlink. I like getting a heads-up that there&rsquo;s some digging to do.</p>
</div>
<p>I also will put notes that I made by hand during a thinking session into my Denote files after they&rsquo;ve had a little time to marinate in my head. I will typically use this step to flesh out ideas that I only got in skeleton form in my notebook.</p>
<p>I really like Denote: it is simple, requires no external dependencies, and it plays nicely with synching systems. Today, thanks to my tag system, links, backlinks, and some searching, I ran into some notes I had taken a year ago and forgot about—but now these notes are helping me with my work right now!</p>

  Summary: what I write and where
  <a class="anchor" href="#summary-what-i-write-and-where">#</a>
</h2>
<p>After thinking a little bit about what mode of note taking benefits most from a given medium, I came up with the following system for myself:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Meeting with my advisor</dt>
<dd>I take meeting notes by hand on paper, usually in my notebook.</dd>
<dt>Thinking through something</dt>
<dd>Again, hand-written, usually on my Rhodia pads as these are typically ephemeral notes. If I get a good idea, I&rsquo;ll write it down in my notebook and then transfer it to my digital Denote notes later.</dd>
<dt>Reading notes</dt>
<dd>If I am reading a technical paper or book that I want to understand, I&rsquo;ll take these notes in my notebook.</dd>
<dt>Research lab notes</dt>
<dd>Digital. I have a template that I fill out every day that helps me keep track of basic information and links all of my daily lab notes to a big note for the whole project. This makes it easy for me to go to that project note and flip through the backlinks.</dd>
<dt>Class notes</dt>
<dd>While I only have one more class left, I still take class notes on my iPad. I feel like class notes benefit the most from a digital-handwriting hybrid.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Should you adopt the setup I have? No. You should arrive to your own system yourself. The only thing I would advise anyone to take from my experience is that you should put a little time and effort into being <em>intentional</em> about how you take notes and how your organize them. You need to find a system that works for <em>you</em>, and only <em>you</em> can do the work to make that happen.</p></article>
