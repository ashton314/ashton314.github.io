<meta name="description" content="I guess I&rsquo;m a runner now.
I never liked running. I did swim team in high school and that was pretty much the only sport I enjoyed. During the pandemic I started running a little bit, but I didn&rsquo;t know very much and when I moved to Salt Lake City to start my PhD I pretty much stopped running entirely because everywhere was so hilly.
Last year I moved again and I saw that I had a nice, flat route I could take for running if I wanted to. I got some better shoes and started following the Couch to 5k training plan. I thought the first weeks would be too easy. I was wrong: every week turned out to be perfectly tuned to what I needed. I finished the training plan and just tried to get out on a run 2–3 times a week.">

<p>I guess I&rsquo;m a runner now.</p>
<p>I never liked running. I did swim team in high school and that was pretty much the only sport I enjoyed. During the pandemic I started running a little bit, but I didn&rsquo;t know very much and when I moved to Salt Lake City to start my PhD I pretty much stopped running entirely because everywhere was so hilly.</p>
<p>Last year I moved again and I saw that I had a nice, flat route I could take for running if I wanted to. I got some better shoes and started following the <a href="https://c25k.com/c25k_plan/">Couch to 5k</a> training plan. I thought the first weeks would be too easy. I was wrong: every week turned out to be perfectly tuned to what I needed. I finished the training plan and just tried to get out on a run 2–3 times a week.</p>
<p>I ran just shy of 200 miles last year!</p>
<p>This is a big change for me health-wise. I was in a bad spot during the first few years of my PhD. I wanted to improve my cardiovascular health to improve longevity and cognitive function. I am <em>really</em> enjoying my runs now, and I feel energized and clearer-headed whenever I finish one. This is not something I thought I would ever say.</p>
<p>Some things that made a big difference for me:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Having a level track to get started on</dt>
<dd>Hills are important for training and I wish I had some where I live. But when I was starting out, it was a good motivator to just have a nice, flat route.</dd>
<dt>Good shoes</dt>
<dd>Good shoes are a must, and they degrade over time. I was running in some 5-year-old runners that didn&rsquo;t provide much cushion. My new ones made my runs much more pleasant, and I&rsquo;ll be getting a new pair once I reach the 300-mile mark.</dd>
<dt>Gentle training plan</dt>
<dd>I did not understand how important rest and stretching were, and I kind of banged up my knees. Having a training plan helped me not overdo my runs so I could keep running and improving over time.</dd>
<dt>Learning about running form</dt>
<dd>I watched some YouTube videos on proper running form. I think I was over-striding and my feet were landing out in front of me on the heel. This put a lot of strain on my legs and my knees hurting tended to be the limiting factor on how often I could run. I still need to go get my gait analyzed, but I have noticed a difference!</dd>
</dl>
<p>Running is good. I enjoy getting out, and I enjoy seeing improvement both in my speed as well as in my alertness and mood post-run. I get a little grumpy on days that I <em>don&rsquo;t</em> get to go for a run. Best kind of addiction I suppose.</p>
