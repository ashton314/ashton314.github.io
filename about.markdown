My name's Ashton Wiersdorf. When I'm not coding I enjoy singing with the [BYU Men's Chorus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choirs_at_Brigham_Young_University). Although I can sing low and loud, I prefer to speak quietly. I'm fairly introverted, so don't be offended if I turn down an invitation. It's nothing personalâ€”I'm probably just tired.

I have been married to my wife Sarah since 2018; we met when we were in high school and she's been my best friend ever since. You can see her blog [here](https://scwiersdorf.github.io/).

My preferred tools are a command line and Emacs. Over the past year I've made some extensive modifications to my configuration. You can get my .emacs config files on [my GitHub repo](https://github.com/ashton314/.dotfiles).
