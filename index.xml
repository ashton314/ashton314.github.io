      <description>I started my PhD program about a year ago. In my first year I have:
Taken 4 &amp;ldquo;normal&amp;rdquo; 3-credit-hour classes Participated in 3 seminars Switched advisors Attended 2 conferences (PLDI @ FCRC, JuliaCon) Presented my work at JuliaCon It&amp;rsquo;s been a lot of work, and there&amp;rsquo;s been a lot of stress. I&amp;rsquo;m in a much better place now than when I started, and over all I&amp;rsquo;m happy where I&amp;rsquo;m at and where I&amp;rsquo;m headed.</description>

      <title>Warp Factor Refactoring in Emacs</title>
      <link>https://lambdaland.org/posts/2023-05-31_warp_factor_refactor/</link>

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s a nifty Emacs workflow for doing a project-wide search-and-replace on steroids. While I do use refactor tools that come with language servers,1 sometimes those aren&amp;rsquo;t enough. Consider the case where you not only need to change the name of a function, but also e.g. need to swap the order of two of its arguments. Or you&amp;rsquo;ve broken one function out into two that need to be chained together. Whatever—there are plenty of ways where the IDE won&amp;rsquo;t be able to do everything that you need.</description>

      <description>I hiked up Desolation Trail with Scott Wiersdorf. It had rained a little bit the night before, so the trail was neither dusty nor muddy—perfect for hiking.

      <title>Writing Racket Macros: define-syntax and phases</title>

      <description>There are a bunch of different ways of writing a macro in Racket. There are also some tricky things around phases to keep in mind. This is to help me keep them all straight.
3+1 ways to make a macro # This form:
(define-syntax-rule (foo args ...) (use args ...)) is equivalent to:
(define-syntax foo (syntax-rules () ([foo args ...] (use args ...)))) Which, is in turn equivalent to:

      <description>I recently made an update to how I build my blog. I like writing my posts with Org-mode because it provides a richer markup language than Markdown. Plus, more Emacs = more good. Hugo has support for Org files, but there was a problem with the RSS feed generation: all of my posts written in Org got truncated at some point. I don&amp;rsquo;t know if the fault lies with Hugo itself or with some problem in the theme I use—whatever it was, I don&amp;rsquo;t have the time right now to debug that and submit a good bug report or a fix.</description>

      <title>The kind of thinking computer science enables</title>
      <link>https://lambdaland.org/posts/2023-05-11_thinking_cs/</link>

      <guid>https://lambdaland.org/posts/2023-05-11_thinking_cs/</guid>
      <description>I believe computer science plays as integral of a part to a well-rounded liberal arts education as does mathematics and linguistics. Why? A liberal arts education is designed to help you think in new and better ways. Computer science teaches novel ways of thinking, reasoning, and approaching problems that are hard to get anywhere else.
I took a class on pedagogy when I encountered this puzzle. I answered the question easily, and I caught myself using reasoning patterns from work in programming coming to the forefront.</description>

      <title>Using a Real Mail Client with Outlook</title>

      <guid>https://lambdaland.org/posts/2023-05-03_email_with_outlook/</guid>
      <description>I recently managed to get access to my Outlook email from Emacs. This took some doing as my university had disabled app passwords. I consider Outlook to be harmful, but inasmuch as companies and schools continue to enforce OAUTH-only authentication with email systems, it is good to find workarounds.
This is how I set up email sending/receiving on my computer running macOS with DavMail. I also use mbsync (confusingly also known as isync) to actually fetch my email, and mu/mu4e to index and read mail.</description>

      <guid>https://lambdaland.org/posts/2023-03-16_appreciation_for_business_programmers/</guid>
      <description>Some years ago I came across a blog post that described programmers as being in one of three camps. It&amp;#39;s a fun, short post, so I encourage you to go read that real quick, but the gist of it is that programmers generally fall into one of three categories according to what they primarily value:
Applied mathematicians, who appreciate elegant solutions to problems. Program execution on von Neumann machines is incidental.</description>

      <description>My grandfather G William Wiersdorf passed away Monday morning. He was 82 and survived COVID, a decades-long existence with MS, and World War II. While his health wasn&amp;#39;t the best, none of us were expecting this. You can read his obituary here.

      <description>The story I once worked as a part of a company with four employees, all of us programmers. We formed a sort of daughter company with a bigger—though still modest-sized—company that handled our payroll and whatnot. Our work directly helped the parent company, but we were organizationally independent development-wise. I really liked working with that small team: we had a one-hour meeting each week to plan out our work, and a short, casual stand-up each morning to get things rolling.</description>

      <description>It&amp;#39;s interesting for me to reflect on how my aspirations have changed as I&amp;#39;ve grown up. When I was a little kid I wanted to be a computer programmer like my daddy. I wanted to have my own cubicle and a work station and write Perl programs all day long in Emacs.
There was a phase where I had to shake my head at that—a cubicle-dweller? Seriously? After experiencing some open-office work spaces, the shoulder-high walls afforded a privacy and sound muffling that any hipster coder would be envious of.</description>

      <title>What is a type system, really?</title>

      <description>Background # This is a question I&amp;rsquo;ve been wrestling with for a little bit. My first experience with a type system was with Java, and I didn&amp;rsquo;t like it. It just felt like an annoying constraint on the kinds of programs I could write. I was coming from Perl, which sports weak dynamic typing, so Java&amp;rsquo;s rigidity came as a bit of a shock.
After Java I learned some C, which too has types.</description>

      <title>Make an Emacs Buffer Open the Way You Want</title>

      <guid>https://lambdaland.org/posts/2022-12-27_repl_buffer_on_the_right/</guid>
      <description>Are you tired of having a particular buffer pop open in the wrong direction? Do you wish, for example, that the Racket REPL buffer showed up on the right in a vertical split, rather than below in a horizontal one? Look no further. I give you, display-buffer-alist:
(add-to-list &amp;#39;display-buffer-alist &amp;#39;(&amp;#34;\\*Racket REPL &amp;lt;/&amp;gt;\\*&amp;#34; (display-buffer-in-direction) (direction . right))) That little snippet will make sure when you hit C-c C-k inside of a racket-mode buffer, a REPL will pop up on the right-side instead of on the bottom.</description>

      <description>This year I discovered the profound joy of giving toys to a little girl. Our daughter is beginning to babble and walk, and nothing has brought me more happiness than playing with her and watching her grow in her capabilities. She&amp;#39;s still young enough that she has no clue as to what is going on, but she did like getting some new toys wrapped in paper and bows! Christmas is so much better giving presents to your kids than it is getting presents as a kid.</description>

      <title>What I Like in a Font for Code</title>

      <description>I&amp;#39;m well aware that I may have a bit of an obsession with fonts. I don&amp;#39;t think that&amp;#39;s too unusual for someone who works in tech, however. Sites like Programming Fonts exist to let people test drive and compare a bunch of different fonts. Just for fun, I thought I&amp;#39;d write up some of the features I look for in a programming font that I&amp;#39;ve come to deliberately pick out.</description>

      <description>In a study that Ars Technica reported on, researchers found that an alarming number of computer repair technicians snooped through clients&amp;#39; devices—and female clients were way more likely to have their data accessed. Yikes!
I once had to take my laptop to get some repairs done. The TAB key on my 2016 MacBook Pro had started glitching, and that wasn&amp;#39;t going to fly when I was working on code and needed my tab completions and app switching to be seamless.</description>

      <description>I had a friend ask me what continuations are, and why they&amp;#39;re useful. There&amp;#39;s a ton of literature about continuations; this is just a simple example meant to showcase something small and hopefully grokkable.
You will need to understand a little bit of Racket, but if you know any Scheme, that should be good enough. If you just want a quick primer, check out Learn X in Y minutes for Racket.</description>

      <title>Unix as a tool forge</title>

      <description>Wikipedia1 cites a few different sources on what &amp;#34;Unix Philosophy&amp;#34; is. Peter Salus summarizes it as:
Write programs that do one thing and do it well. Write programs to work together. Write programs to handle text streams, because that is a universal interface. That second bullet point is my favorite: making composable programs rather than monolithic systems. In this way, Unix is designed to be a forge for easily building new tools.</description>

      <description>Yes, it&amp;rsquo;s time to redo my blog again.
This time I found an ultra light-weight blog theme. This page here is under 100KB!
I wanted to make something that acts more like a homepage for my research, rather than a blog. I still have all my blog posts, but now the focus will be on a more professional presentation of my work.
This theme is really what I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted all along: a home page with a max-width for the text, table of contents, and built-in local search!</description>

      <description>It&amp;#39;s hard to overstate how important email is in our modern world. Even as hip new platforms like Slack &amp;amp;co. gain traction in the workplace, so much communication takes place in a crusty old medium that&amp;#39;s outlived every purported &amp;#34;email killer&amp;#34;. Where does it get its staying power from?
Email predates much of the Internet as we know it today. Its current incarnation first emerged in the early 80s, though it has roots in earlier forms of digital messaging from as far back as the 60s.</description>

      <description>Something I learned today from a coworker: if you turn your monitor sideways, subpixel anti-aliasing gets completely broken. This isn&amp;#39;t as much of an issue on today&amp;#39;s high-dpi displays, but for anything lower than a 4k screen, the effect can be noticeable.
Just a little interesting thing I learned today. Thanks to my good, knowledgeable friend and coworker Jonner Steck!
Also, while we&amp;#39;re on the topic of font rendering, I&amp;#39;ve updated Iosevka Output to more closely match Input Mono: the cross-bar on the f now lines up nicely with the x-height.</description>

      <description>This week I created a custom build of the Iosevka font. I&amp;#39;ve used Input Mono for a long time now, and was very happy with it. However, it was missing a few glyphs that I wanted to use. Moreover, I didn&amp;#39;t have a license for the Input font to use on e.g. my blog. Iosevka is stupendously customizable, so I thought I&amp;#39;d see if I could get something close to Input&amp;#39;s styles.</description>

Synopsis Experimental type checker/inferer for a simple lambda calculus
Description This is a type inference system for a little language. (Described below.) It uses a fusion of type inference algorithms from PLAI, ESP, and μKanren. (See Resources)
Broadly speaking, our type inference engine works by:
generating typing constraints from the program solving those constraints We&amp;#39;ll describe each of those in more detail.</description>

I post only occasionally, usually to show off my recent hiking exploits. I&amp;rsquo;ve come up with some rules for myself (all subject to change) about what I post.
A post must meet all the following criteria:
It must be positive and uplifting.

      <guid>https://lambdaland.org/posts/2022-07-04_kanren/</guid>
      <description>μKanren (&amp;ldquo;micro-Kanren&amp;rdquo;) is a tiny, embeddable logic programming language. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to understand and implement in almost any language. It&amp;rsquo;s a great case study of an embedded language: unlike other common &amp;ldquo;embedded&amp;rdquo; languages like SQL or regex, which normally are represented as just plain-old strings, μKanren takes more advantage of the host language&amp;rsquo;s features.
I recommend reading the original paper: it&amp;rsquo;s short, well-written, and easy to understand.
I did a write-up which you can read on Sourcehut.</description>

      <description>Brief update on the blog: I had been running a custom fork of the Anatole theme; it diverged pretty heavily, and I found a nice way to customize the CSS. Behold! The new-and-improved blog.
Some of the new extensions to Anatole include the ability to set a static page as your profile; I&amp;rsquo;ll do this and include links to lists of publications and whatnot. This should make my blog a better place for my professional/academic life.</description>

      <description>I have a hard time keeping these terms straight:
liveness vs. safety soundness vs. completeness This is intended as a short guide for myself; maybe someone else will find it useful too! Note that this is all to the best of my knowledge and understanding at the present time; if there be faults, they be the faults of myself. I welcome correction and clarification if I am wrong.
Liveness vs. Safety # Liveness and safety deal with properties of a system.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s my first Christmas being a dad. The end of the school semester was unusually stressful; I didn&amp;rsquo;t have much time or energy to anticipate Christmas. But I&amp;rsquo;ve felt a marked lack of eagerness for getting presents. That feeling wanes each year—something I&amp;rsquo;m grateful for—but this year I only felt an eagerness for a time of peace and celebration with my family. Peaceful it has been.
My family isn&amp;rsquo;t perfect. (My baby daughter is about as perfect as they come, though!</description>

      <title>Foundations of High-Modernist Ideology in Metropolis</title>

      <description>The following is from a essay from a class on German literature and film.
Fritz Lang’s movie Metropolis is primarily about the struggle between the oppressed working class and the ruling elite. What drives this tension, however, is a particular view of technology and technological progress that exacerbates the problems the film focuses on. This mentality is called high modernist ideology by Scott in his book Seeing Like a State:</description>

      <description>What does this program do? At the most reduced level, one could say that a program&amp;rsquo;s behavior is defined by the effect it has on the hardware running it. That&amp;rsquo;s not very useful however; when we&amp;rsquo;re programming, we often have to deal with legacy code and tease out the original intent of the code.
Saying that the meaning of a program is entirely encapsulated by the code is saying that the intent and the implementation are the same.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I feel uncomfortable with many symbols. I might have opinions about a subject, but there&amp;rsquo;s rarely a camp that has some symbol, flag, slogan, etc. that I&amp;rsquo;m comfortable with adopting because that camp does not accurately reflect my opinion. All too often, a slogan takes on more than its surface meaning, and that can make using that slogan tricky.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>My wife and I got a chance to go to a place that lets you paint pottery and then have it fired. The pottery is all pre-made; you just get to paint it.
It&amp;rsquo;s been a very long time since I&amp;rsquo;ve worked with a physical art medium, so the mug looks kinda dumpy. I did alright with the Racket logo on the bottom-inside of the mug though!
I&amp;rsquo;m working on some fun projects with Racket.</description>

She alternates between screaming at 90+ decibels and sleeping fitfully. She only transfers from the crying state to the sleep state after prolonged, labored rocking and soothing. She transfers back to the base crying state on her own after a few seconds.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Control-Flow Analysis is a popular technique for performing static analysis of many different kinds of programming languages.
It&amp;rsquo;s most often needed in cases where you have some kind of dynamic dispatch: either where you have first-class functions or when you have objects and you call one of their methods.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Although it claims it&amp;rsquo;s trustworthy, it&amp;rsquo;s not open-source, so no one can verify their claims. So naturally, I was reluctant to install it on my primary machine. Enter: the spare raspberry pi I have sitting around.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is the story of how I managed to get FreeBSD running on a Raspberry Pi 4 with 4GB of RAM, though I think the setup story is pretty similar for those with 2GB and 8GB.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also managed to get Rust built from source, (kind of) which is nice because the default Rust installer doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to work for FreeBSD running on a Raspberry Pi.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>I noticed that my Internet was acting strangely: whenever I visited a web page, my browser would hang for a good second or two before it started loading anything. Zoom calls worked without a problem for school, so this tipped me off that something was wrong with the DNS lookup or the handshake.
Sure enough, I popped open my Pi-Hole admin console, and was greeted with this:
The green number in the Total Queries box would jump by 10, 20, or sometimes even 100 every second.</description>

      <description>&lt;!-- Introduction --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology&lt;/em&gt;, Neil Postman argues that our infatuation with technology has insidiously eroded our culture. We gain much through technology, but it comes at a price; all too often we are blind to that price. This book seeks to call attention to the costs of a technology-focused society. I felt this poignantly because I, as a technology worker, know what that infatuation feels like.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about programming languages a lot recently. A question I asked myself was: why do we work on, refine, and create new programming languages?
I thought of several reasons, but they seemed to boil down into two broader reasons:
Better abstractions and more automation: some languages automate and ease some tedious tasks like memory management, concurrency, or type annotations. Almost all languages give you some ways of creating abstractions that let you reason with concepts in your problem domain, but different languages do this in different ways.</description>

      <description>I went on an adventure today. I left behind the stable comforts of the terminal and compiled bleeding-edge Emacs that uses a native window system.
This is a big deal for me. As long as I can remember, I&amp;rsquo;ve used Emacs from within a terminal. I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to give the GUI&amp;rsquo;d Emacs a whirl.
My Journey # I&amp;rsquo;m running macOS Catalina (10.15.5). Originally I tried using the pre-built packages via brew (brew cask install emacs) and those available at Emacs for Mac OS X.</description>

      <description>An analogy occurred to me this evening as I was thinking about programming language design:
Choosing good keywords and function names is like picking a good font; the ideas conveyed may be the same, but a change can drastically impact legibility and enjoyment of use.
PHP does a spectacular job of providing a bad example. It&amp;rsquo;s like the Comic Sans of programming languages. Now there are many reasons why PHP is not a good language—I&amp;rsquo;d like to investigate this particular aspect of its design here briefly.</description>

      <description>Overview # The primary thrust of this book is that television has degraded our mode of public discourse. Our news, politics, education, and even religion are delivered to us primarily through television, where they were once delivered via the written word. This transformation of medium is not irrelevant: just as poetry doesn&amp;rsquo;t survive fully intact when translated from one language to another, likewise ideas do not survive translation of medium.</description>

      <description>Masks have become a hot issue. Here&amp;rsquo;s my 2¢.
Summary # I think everyone should wear a mask, unless they have a compelling medical reason not to.
Look at it this way: a mask will either help you and those around you, or it will do no harm—beyond a little social awkwardness. If we look at the trade-offs in a game-theory-style matrix, we get:
| | Masks Help | Masks don&amp;rsquo;t help | |&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;-+&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;+&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;| | Wear a mask | +100 | 0 | | Don&amp;rsquo;t wear a mask | -100 | 0 |</description>

      <description>Computers are funny things. At the lowest level they&amp;rsquo;re just a pile of ones and zeros that we assign meaning to. It&amp;rsquo;s something you can easily take for granted, but there&amp;rsquo;s a disconnect with how we talk about how things operate at the hardware level and then again at the software level.
Since writing a compiler, I&amp;rsquo;ve been able to bridge that gap in part. The fundamental idea is that we represent some meaning in a concrete, though still high-level form.</description>

      <title>Starting Fresh</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been building a compiler for a small lambda calculus that compiles to x86. It&amp;rsquo;s pretty broken, and I decided to start from scratch. I checked out a new branch in Git, and then deleted the entirety of my compiler before I had a chance to do anything else.
It hurt. But it was a good kind of hurt.
I don&amp;rsquo;t usually just blow everything away like that. Even this time, I&amp;rsquo;m keeping many of my auxiliary functions.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a FreeBSD guy. My first computer was a FreeBSD machine that my dad had running in a closet. I learned how to use Emacs as well as the command line on that black-screen white-text no-mouse interface. That&amp;rsquo;s how real programmers spend their childhood! 😎 😜
I&amp;rsquo;ve only heard good things about FreeBSD. While not known as particularly desktop-friendly (various Linux distros win here) I&amp;rsquo;ve heard tales of its rock-solid stability.</description>

      <description>Yet again, I&amp;rsquo;ve tweaked my emacs configuration. The big change this time is switching to Ivy from Helm.
I&amp;rsquo;d like to say right off the bat that Helm is a great tool. I used it for several months and enjoyed it. Once thing that I love about helm is how discoverable it makes commands and functions. helm also got me into using bookmarks. I don&amp;rsquo;t keep many bookmarks; I tend to collect a few when working on a multi-file project long-term.</description>

      <title>Citations with Pandoc</title>

      <guid>https://lambdaland.org/posts/2019-02-06-citations-with-pandoc/</guid>
      <description>Today I figured out how to get Pandoc to automatically generate MLA citations for me!
I used Pandoc and the Biblatex bibliography format. What&amp;rsquo;s nice about this is that you can enter in all the information you know about the source, keep it nice and organized in a file, and then change the citation style on the fly. Imagine if you thought you had to use MLA, but then realized you needed to switch to APA citation styles.</description>

      <description>Marked Man (mm) is a little program I wrote to view Markdown files like UNIX man pages. (Because who wants to leave their terminal just to open a file?)
It uses Pandoc to convert between Markdown and the groff format. As a happy side-effect, this program can read basically anything as a man page: HTML, LaTeX, Word files (seriously), ePub, etc. Anything that Pandoc can read, Marked Man can handle.</description>

I might do an internship in Berlin some time but we&amp;rsquo;ll see if that pans out. :) Check out the list at kennedy.byu.edu.</description>

      <description>DuckDuckGo is a search engine. Like Google Search, you just throw some keywords into a box and get a list of results. Lots of people use Google, but I don&amp;rsquo;t. DuckDuckGo works better for me, and this is why.
The Duck ## Consistent Results Did you know that Google will give you different search results, based on who you are and what you have searched for in the past? This is called a filter bubble, and it&amp;rsquo;s annoying and dangerous.</description>

Disqus has their privacy policy here. They make money through advertising, which is unfortunate, because that means they&amp;rsquo;re selling some of your (and my) data to third parties. That&amp;rsquo;s pretty common these days. :-/

      <description>Life is messy. We devote a lot of time and effort into managing that chaos. I thought of a little &amp;ldquo;theory&amp;rdquo;, if you will, that helps me.
The Home Theory # Everything needs a home. The class of things that need homes is broad. It includes:
School assignments Legal documents Pictures Recipies Ideas Projects Books Charging cables Tools etc. The home needs to suit the thing that goes there. I have found that getting this right is really tricky.</description>

One of my favorite books is Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance. Contrary to what the title suggests, this book is actually not about motorcycles. It’s about a lot of things; one topic is about tools and caring about your trade.</description>

      <description>September 30th marked two years since I arrived home from serving a two-year mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The mission is colloquially referred to as &amp;ldquo;the best two years&amp;rdquo;. (There is a movie about missionaries, which I have not seen, by this title.)
My time on the mission did constitute the best two years of my life. I grew and learned so much in that time.</description>

      <description>Today in my proofs class (MATH 290 at BYU) we talked about the concept induction. I like this, because it sounds a lot like recursion.
On the Wikipedia article, there&amp;rsquo;s an excerpt from a book that illustrates the principle with an analogy using a ladder:
Mathematical induction proves that we can climb as high as we like on a ladder, by proving that we can climb onto the bottom rung (the basis) and that from each rung we can climb up to the next one (the step).</description>

      <description>Life Hacks: Text Notifications # So many notifications come to us in the form of an audible alert, and this can sometimes be inconvenient. Who likes having their phone go off in church? The problem is that sound propagates regardless of the intended target. Touch, on the other hand, is an inherently personal sensation. Setting your phone to vibrate lets you know you&amp;rsquo;re being alerted, without notifying everyone else in the room as well.</description>

There&amp;rsquo;s an asterisk there. I&amp;rsquo;m not going to delete my account, but I&amp;rsquo;m no longer checking Facebook more than once or twice a month, if that. I&amp;rsquo;m not trying to be a recluse—below are a few ways to contact me that I do check far more often than Facebook. I want to be your friend, but I&amp;rsquo;d rather that friendship be through a real connection rather than some online &amp;ldquo;status&amp;rdquo;.</description>

I met Sarah almost five years ago on trek.1 We stayed in touch afterwards, and look where we ended up! Below are some stories from our courtship.
First time seeing each other # It was the first day of trek. I found my family and sat down at the most extreme end of the bench. I got to know my trek brothers a little bit, but mostly kept to myself.</description>

      <description>I came across a quote posted by a friend of mine that read:
The difference between spiritualism and religion is that spiritualism is pro-light, while religion is anti-sin.
Or something to that effect. This quote bothered me because I felt that it maligned religion. I asked this friend for some clarification; it seemed clear from their response that they had had a rather negative experience with religion. They explained that they felt that religion (in general) micro-manages the lives of its adherents and focuses on telling people what they can&amp;rsquo;t do.</description>

      <description>I once asked my dad over email how to improve my the potency of my words and thoughts. His reply came back as one word:
Revision.
Good writing does not emerge spontaneously; it comes as one practices writing. A &amp;ldquo;draft&amp;rdquo; is a pass of writing a particular work. It&amp;rsquo;s like sketching in art: when an artist starts a painting, they usually start with a rough sketch outlining where the ﬁgures will be, what the landscape will be like, etc.</description>

This can get rather irksome. Imagine reading text looking for vulgar words or phrases. Yuck. I took some time this evening to write a little website that checks MetroLyrics for any vulgar words or phrases.</description>

      <description>Quick note for those who don&amp;rsquo;t know about Docker: Docker is a program that lets me take packaged-up programs (called images or containers) and run them without having to worry much about dependencies.
Today I decided to upgrade my version of Ghost Blog. I&amp;rsquo;m using the Docker image on a Digital Ocean droplet. Updating should be simple, I thought. I would take down the blog then spin it back up again after pulling down the latest Docker image.</description>

My most recent place of employment outside of academia was with Spiff, where they were nice enough to let me hack on their interpreter. Before Spiff I worked at a few other positions as a full-stack engineer.
I&amp;rsquo;ve sung with the BYU Men&amp;rsquo;s Chorus and I play the piano.</description>
